The
twenty-one verses of this book contain the shortest and sternest prophecy in
the Old Testament. Nothing is known of the author, although his oracle against
Edom, a long-standing enemy of Israel, indicates a date of composition sometime
in the fifth century B.C. During this period the Edomites had been forced to
abandon their ancient home near the Gulf of Aqaba and had settled in southern
Judah, where they appear among the adversaries of the Jews returning from
exile. The prophecy is a bitter cry for vengeance against Edom for its heinous
crimes. The mountain of Esau will be occupied and ravaged by the enemy but Zion
shall remain inviolate. Judah and Israel shall again form one nation; and that
triumphant refrain of Israelite eschatology will be heard once more: "The
Kingdom is the Lord's!" Many of the verses in this prophecy can be paralleled
in 
⇒
 Jeremiah 49:7-22 but it is difficult to
determine the precise relationship between these similar passages. 
1
The vision of Obadiah. (Thus says the Lord
GOD:) Of Edom we have heard a message from the LORD, and a herald has been sent
among the nations: "Up! let us go to war against him!" 
2
See, I make you small among the nations; you
are held in dire contempt. 
3
The pride of your heart has deceived you: you
who dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose abode is in the heights, Who say in
your heart, "Who will bring me down to earth?" 
4
Though you go as high as the eagle, and your
nest be set among the stars, From there will I bring you down, says the LORD. 
5
If thieves came to you, if robbers by night,
how could you be thus destroyed: would they not steal merely till they had
enough? If vintagers came to you, would they not leave some gleanings? 
[1]
6
How they search Esau, seek out his hiding
places! 
7
[2]
 To the border they drive you -  all your allies; They deceive you, they
overpower you -  those at peace with
you; Those who eat your bread lay snares beneath you: There is no understanding
in him! 
8
[3]
 Shall I not, says the LORD, on that day make
the wise men disappear from Edom, and understanding from the mount of Esau? 
9
[4]
 Your warriors, O Teman, shall be crushed, till
all on Mount Esau are destroyed. 
10
[5]
 Because of violence to your brother Jacob,
disgrace shall cover you and you shall be destroyed forever. 
11
[6]
 On the day when you stood by, on the day when
aliens carried off his possessions, And strangers entered his gates and cast
lots over Jerusalem, you too were one of them. 
12
Gaze not upon the day of your brother, the day
of his disaster; Exult not over the children of Judah on the day of their ruin;
Speak not haughtily on the day of distress! 
13
Enter not the gate of my people on the day of
their calamity; Gaze not, you at least, upon his misfortune on the day of his
calamity; Lay not hands upon his possessions on the day of his calamity! 
14
Stand not at the crossroads to slay his
refugees; Betray not his fugitives on the day of distress! 
15
For near is the day of the LORD for all the
nations! As you have done, so shall it be done to you, your deed shall come
back upon your own head; 
16
[7]
 As you have drunk upon my holy mountain, so
shall all the nations drink continually. Yes, they shall drink and swallow, and
shall become as though they had not been. 
17
[8]
 But on Mount Zion there shall be a portion
saved; the mountain shall be holy, And the house of Jacob shall take possession
of those that dispossessed them. 
18
The house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the
house of Joseph a flame; The house of Esau shall be stubble, and they shall set
them ablaze and devour them; Then none shall survive of the house of Esau, for
the LORD has spoken. 
19
They shall occupy the Negeb, the mount of Esau,
and the foothills of the Philistines; And they shall occupy the lands of
Ephraim and the lands of Samaria, and Benjamin shall occupy Gilead. 
20
[9]
 The captives of the host of the children of
Israel shall occupy the Canaanite land as far as Zarephath, And the captives of
Jerusalem who are in Sepharad shall occupy the cities of the Negeb. 
21
[10]
 And saviors shall ascend Mount Zion to rule
the mount of Esau, and the kingship shall be the LORD'S. 
1
 [5] Something of value may escape
the robber, and the vintager always leaves something for the gleaners, but
God's devastation of Edom will be complete. 
2
 [7] There is no understanding in
him: Edom's faithless allies assure one another that he does not have sense
enough to be able to defend himself.
3
 [8] The wise men: Edom was
proverbial for its wise men; cf 
⇒
 Jeremiah 49:7.
4
 [9] Teman: one of the names used
for the land southeast of Palestine, here synonymous with Edom. Esau: here used
as the name of the land.
5
 [10] Your brother Jacob: Esau, also
called Edom, and Jacob, the father of Judah, were the sons of Isaac (
⇒
 Genesis
25:24-26).
6
 [11] After the devastation of
Judah, Edom occupied the southern part of its territory. Edomites also joined
the invading Chaldean forces (
⇒
 Obadiah 1:13) and
assisted them in capturing the people of Judah (
⇒
1:14).
7
 [16] As you have drunk: the Lord
addresses the people of Judah. As the people of Jerusalem have drunk the cup of
retribution, so shall the nations, and especially Edom
(
⇒
 Obadiah 1:18), suffer punishment. This
metaphorical use of drinking the cup of God's wrath is common in the Bible; cf
⇒
 Job 21:20; 
⇒
 Isaiah
19:14; 
⇒
 Jeremiah 25:15-16.
8
 [17-19] The Israelites shall be
restored and shall occupy the lands of those who oppressed them. The survivors
of Judah shall be rejoined by the returned exiles from northern Israel.
9
 [20] Zarephath: a town in
Phoenicia, north of Tyre; cf 
⇒
 1 Kings 17:10.
Ezekiel's ideal boundaries of the new Israel (
⇒
 Ezekiel
47:13-15) extend farther north. Sepharad: probably Sardis in western
Asia Minor. The later rabbis thought it to be Spain.
10
 [21] Saviors:the victorious
Israelites who will rule over their enemies after the fashion of the ancient
Judges; cf

 Judges 3:9,

 15,
