1
But the LORD sent a large fish, that swallowed
Jonah; and he remained in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. 
2
From the belly of the fish Jonah said this
prayer to the LORD, his God: 
3
Out of my distress I called to the LORD, and he
answered me; From the midst of the nether world I cried for help, and you heard
my voice. 
4
For you cast me into the deep, into the heart
of the sea, and the flood enveloped me; All your breakers and your billows
passed over me. 
5
Then I said, "I am banished from your
sight! yet would I again look upon your holy temple." 
6
The waters swirled about me, threatening my
life; the abyss enveloped me; seaweed clung about my head. 
7
Down I went to the roots of the mountains; the
bars of the nether world were closing behind me forever, But you brought my
life up from the pit, O LORD, my God. 
8
When my soul fainted within me, I remembered
the LORD; My prayer reached you in your holy temple. 
9
Those who worship vain idols forsake their
source of mercy. 
10
But I, with resounding praise, will sacrifice
to you; What I have vowed I will pay: deliverance is from the LORD. 
11
Then the LORD commanded the fish to spew Jonah
upon the shore. 
The word of the LORD came to Jonah a second
time: 
2
"Set out for the great city of Nineveh,
and announce to it the message that I will tell you." 
3
So Jonah made ready and went to Nineveh, according
to the LORD'S bidding. Now Nineveh was an enormously large city; it took three
days to go through it. 
4
[1]
 Jonah began his journey through the city, and
had gone but a single day's walk announcing, "Forty days more and Nineveh
shall be destroyed," 
5
when the people of Nineveh believed God; they
proclaimed a fast and all of them, great and small, put on sackcloth. 
6
When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he
rose from his throne, laid aside his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and
sat in the ashes. 
7
Then he had this proclaimed throughout Nineveh,
by decree of the king and his nobles: "Neither man nor beast, neither
cattle nor sheep, shall taste anything; they shall not eat, nor shall they
drink water. 
8
[2]
 Man and beast shall be covered with sackcloth
and call loudly to God; every man shall turn from his evil way and from the
violence he has in hand. 
9
Who knows, God may relent and forgive, and
withhold his blazing wrath, so that we shall not perish." 
10
When God saw by their actions how they turned
from their evil way, he repented of the evil that he had threatened to do to
them; he did not carry it out. 
1
 [4] Shall be destroyed: the Hebrew
expression reminds the reader of the "overthrowing" of the wicked
cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, by a special act of God. 
2
 [8] Beast . . . sackcloth: the
animals carried the signs of this repentance, as on occasions of joy they bore
garlands.
