Introduction
Written in the
postexilic era, probably in the fifth century B.C., this book is a didactic
story with an important theological message. It concerns a disobedient prophet
who attempted to run away from his divine commission, was cast overboard and
swallowed by a great fish, rescued in a marvelous manner, and sent on his way
to Nineveh, the traditional enemy of Israel. To the surprise of Jonah, the
wicked city listened to his message of doom and repented immediately. All, from
king to lowliest subject, humbled themselves in sackcloth and ashes. Seeing
their repentance, God did not carry out the punishment he had planned for them.
Whereupon Jonah complained to God about the unexpected success of his mission;
he was bitter because Yahweh, instead of destroying, had led the people to
repentance and then spared them.
From this partly humorous
story, a very sublime lesson may be drawn. Jonah stands for a narrow and
vindictive mentality, all too common among the Jews of that period. Because
they were the chosen people, a good many of them cultivated an intolerant
nationalism which limited the mercy of God to their nation. It was abhorrent to
their way of thinking that nations as wicked as Assyria should escape his
wrath.
The prophecy, which is both
instructive and entertaining, strikes directly at this viewpoint. It is a
parable of mercy, showing that God's threatened punishments are but the
expression of a merciful will which moves all men to repent and seek
forgiveness. The universality of the story contrasts sharply with the
particularistic spirit of many in the postexilic community. The book has also
prepared the way for the gospel with its message of redemption for all, both
Jew and Gentile.
