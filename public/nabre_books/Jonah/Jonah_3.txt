Chapter
 3
1
The word of the LORD came to Jonah a second
time: 
2
"Set out for the great city of Nineveh,
and announce to it the message that I will tell you." 
3
So Jonah made ready and went to Nineveh,
according to the LORD'S bidding. Now Nineveh was an enormously large city; it
took three days to go through it. 
4
[1]
 Jonah began his journey through the city, and
had gone but a single day's walk announcing, "Forty days more and Nineveh
shall be destroyed," 
5
when the people of Nineveh believed God; they
proclaimed a fast and all of them, great and small, put on sackcloth. 
6
When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he
rose from his throne, laid aside his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and
sat in the ashes. 
7
Then he had this proclaimed throughout Nineveh,
by decree of the king and his nobles: "Neither man nor beast, neither
cattle nor sheep, shall taste anything; they shall not eat, nor shall they
drink water. 
8
[2]
 Man and beast shall be covered with sackcloth
and call loudly to God; every man shall turn from his evil way and from the
violence he has in hand. 
9
Who knows, God may relent and forgive, and
withhold his blazing wrath, so that we shall not perish." 
10
When God saw by their actions how they turned
from their evil way, he repented of the evil that he had threatened to do to
them; he did not carry it out. 
1
 [4] Shall be destroyed: the Hebrew
expression reminds the reader of the "overthrowing" of the wicked
cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, by a special act of God. 
2
 [8] Beast . . . sackcloth: the
animals carried the signs of this repentance, as on occasions of joy they bore
garlands.
