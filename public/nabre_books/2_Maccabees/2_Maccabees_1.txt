The Jews in Jerusalem and in the land of Judea
send greetings to their brethren, the Jews in Egypt, and wish them true peace! 
2
May God bless you and remember his covenant
with his faithful servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 
3
May he give to all of you a heart to worship
him and to do his will readily and generously. 
4
May he open your heart to his law and his
commandments and grant you peace. 
5
May he hear your prayers, and be reconciled to
you, and never forsake you in time of adversity. 
6
Even now we are praying for you here.

[1]
 In the reign of Demetrius, the year one
hundred and sixty-nine, we Jews wrote to you during the trouble and violence
that overtook us in those years after Jason and his followers had revolted
against the holy land and the kingdom, 
8
[2]
 setting fire to the gatehouse and shedding
innocent blood. But we prayed to the Lord, and our prayer was heard; we offered
sacrifices and fine flour; we lighted the lamps and set out the loaves of
bread. 
9
[3]
 We are now reminding you to celebrate the
feast of Booths in the month of Chislev. 
10
[4]
 Dated in the year one hundred and eighty-eight.
The people of Jerusalem and Judea, the senate, and Judas send greetings and
good wishes to Aristobulus, counselor of King Ptolemy and member of the family
of the anointed priests, and to the Jews in Egypt. 
11
[5]
 Since we have been saved by God from grave
dangers, we give him great thanks for having fought on our side against the
king; 
12
it was he who drove out those who fought
against the holy city. 
13
[6]
 When their leader arrived in Persia with his
seemingly irresistible army, they were cut to pieces in the temple of the
goddess Nanea through a deceitful stratagem employed by Nanea's priests. 
14
[7]
 On the pretext of marrying the goddess,
Antiochus with his Friends had come to the place to get its great treasures by
way of dowry. 
15
When the priests of the Nanaeon had displayed
the treasures, Antiochus with a few attendants came to the temple precincts. As
soon as he entered the temple, the priests locked the doors. 
16
Then they opened a hidden trapdoor in the
ceiling, hurled stones at the leader and his companions and struck them down.
They dismembered the bodies, cut off their heads and tossed them to the people
outside. 
17
Forever blessed be our God, who has thus
punished the wicked! 
18
[8]
[9]
 We shall be celebrating
the purification of the temple on the twenty-fifth day of the month Chislev, so
we thought it right to inform you, that you too may celebrate the feast of
Booths and of the fire that appeared when Nehemiah, the rebuilder of the temple
and the altar, offered sacrifices. 
19
[10]
 When our fathers were being exiled to Persia,
devout priests of the time took some of the fire from the altar and hid it
secretly in the hollow of a dry cistern, making sure that the place would be
unknown to anyone. 
20
Many years later, when it so pleased God,
Nehemiah, commissioned by the king of Persia, sent the descendants of the
priests who had hidden the fire to look for it. 
21
When they informed us that they could not find
any fire, but only muddy water, he ordered them to scoop some out and bring it.
After the material for the sacrifices had been prepared, Nehemiah ordered the
priests to sprinkle with the water the wood and what lay on it. 
22
When this was done and in time the sun, which
had been clouded over, began to shine, a great fire blazed up, so that everyone
marveled. 
23
While the sacrifice was being burned, the
priests recited a prayer, and all present joined in with them, Jonathan leading
and the rest responding with Nehemiah. 
24
The prayer was as follows: "Lord, Lord
God, creator of all things, awesome and strong, just and merciful, the only
king and benefactor, 
25
who alone are gracious, just, almighty, and
eternal, Israel's savior from all evil, who chose our forefathers and
sanctified them: 
26
accept this sacrifice on behalf of all your
people Israel and guard and sanctify your heritage. 
27
Gather together our scattered people, free
those who are the slaves of the Gentiles, look kindly on those who are despised
and detested, and let the Gentiles know that you are our God. 
28
Punish those who tyrannize over us and
arrogantly mistreat us. 
29
Plant your people in your holy place, as Moses promised."
30
Then the priests began to sing hymns. 
31
After the sacrifice was burned, Nehemiah
ordered the rest of the liquid to be poured upon large stones. 
32
As soon as this was done, a flame blazed up,
but its light was lost in the brilliance cast from a light on the altar. 
33
When the event became known and the king of the
Persians was told that, in the very place where the exiled priests had hidden
the fire, a liquid was found with which Nehemiah and his people had burned the
sacrifices, 
34
the king, after verifying the fact, fenced the
place off and declared it sacred. 
35
To those on whom the king wished to bestow
favors he distributed the large revenues he received there. 
36
[11]
 Nehemiah and his companions called the liquid
nephthar, meaning purification, but most people named it naphtha. 
1
 [7] Demetrius: Demetrius II, king
of Syria (145-139, 129-125 B.C.). The year one hundred and sixty-nine of the
Seleucid era, 143 B.C. Regarding the dates in 1 and 2 Mc, see note on
⇒
 1 Macc 1:10. On the troubles caused by Jason and
his revolt against the kingdom, i.e., the rule of the legitimate high priest,
see 
⇒
 2 Macc 4:7-22. 
2
 [8] Our prayer was heard: in the
ultimate victory of the Maccabees.

 [9] Feast of Booths in the month of
Chislev: really the feast of the Dedication of the temple
(
⇒
 2 Macc 10:1-8), celebrated on the twenty-fifth
of Chislev (Nov.-Dec.). Its solemnity resembles that of the true feast of
Booths (
⇒
 Lev 23:33-43), celebrated on the
fifteenth of Tishri (Sept.-Oct.); cf 
⇒
 2 Macc 1:18.
4
 [10] 124 B.C. The date pertains to
the preceding, not the following letter. King Ptolemy: Ptolemy VI Philometor,
ruler of Egypt from 180 to 145 B.C.; he is mentioned also in
⇒
 1 Macc 1:18;
⇒
 10:51-59.
5
 [11-12] The king: Antiochus IV of
Syria, the bitter persecutor of the Jews, who, as leader of the Syrian army
that invaded Persia, perished there in 164 B.C.
6
 [13] Nanea: an oriental goddess
comparable to Artemis of the Greeks.
7
 [14-17] A different account of the death
of Antiochus IV is given in 
⇒
 2 Macc 9:1-29, and
another variant account in 
⇒
 1 Macc 6:1-16. The
writer of this letter had probably heard a distorted rumor of the king's death.
This fact and other indications show that the letter was written very soon
after Antiochus IV died, hence in 164 B.C.
8
 [18-36] This purely legendary
account of Nehemiah's miraculous fire is incorporated in the letter because of
its connection with the temple and its rededication.
9
 [18] Nehemiah, the rebuilder of the
temple he: rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem, but the temple had been rebuilt by
Zerubbabel almost a century before.
10
 [19] Persia: actually Babylonia,
which later became part of the Persian Empire.
11
 [36] By a play on words, the Greek
term naphtha (petroleum) is assimilated to some Semitic word, perhaps nephthar,
meaning "loosened."
