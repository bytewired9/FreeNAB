 You will find in the records, not only that
Jeremiah the prophet ordered the deportees to take some of the aforementioned
fire with them, 
2
but also that the prophet, in giving them the
law, admonished them not to forget the commandments of the Lord or be led
astray in their thoughts, when seeing the gold and silver idols and their
ornaments. 
3
With other similar words he urged them not to
let the law depart from their hearts. 
4
[2]
 The same document also tells how the prophet,
following a divine revelation, ordered that the tent and the ark should
accompany him and how he went off to the mountain which Moses climbed to see
God's inheritance. 
5
When Jeremiah arrived there, he found a room in
a cave in which he put the tent, the ark, and the altar of incense; then he
blocked up the entrance. 
6
Some of those who followed him came up
intending to mark the path, but they could not find it. 
7
When Jeremiah heard of this, he reproved them:
"The place is to remain unknown until God gathers his people together
again and shows them mercy. 
8
[3]
 Then the Lord will disclose these things, and
the glory of the Lord will be seen in the cloud, just as it appeared in the
time of Moses and when Solomon prayed that the Place might be gloriously
sanctified." 
9
It is also related how Solomon in his wisdom
offered a sacrifice at the dedication and the completion of the temple. 
10
Just as Moses prayed to the Lord and fire
descended from the sky and consumed the sacrifices, so Solomon also prayed and
fire came down and burned up the holocausts. 
11
[4]
 Moses had said, "Because it had not been
eaten, the sin offering was burned up." 
12
Solomon also celebrated the feast in the same
way for eight days. 
13
[5]
 Besides these things, it is also told in the records
and in Nehemiah's Memoirs how he collected the books about the kings, the
writings of the prophets and of David, and the royal letters about sacred
offerings. 
14
In like manner Judas also collected for us the
books that had been scattered because of the war, and we now have them in our
possession. 
15
If you need them, send messengers to get them
for you. 
16
As we are about to celebrate the feast of the
purification of the temple, we are writing to you requesting you also to please
celebrate the feast. 
17
It is God who has saved all his people and has
restored to all of them their heritage, the kingdom, the priesthood, and the
sacred rites, 
18
as he promised through the law. We trust in
God, that he will soon have mercy on us and gather us together from everywhere
under the heavens to his holy Place, for he has rescued us from great perils
and has purified his Place. 
19
This is the story of Judas Maccabeus and his
brothers, of the purification of the great temple, the dedication of the altar,
20
[6]
 the campaigns against Antiochus Epiphanes and
his son Eupator, 
21
and of the heavenly manifestations accorded to
the heroes who fought bravely for Judaism, so that, few as they were, they
seized the whole land, put to flight the barbarian hordes, 
22
regained possession of the world-famous temple,
liberated the city, and reestablished the laws that were in danger of being
abolished, while the Lord favored them with all his generous assistance. 
23
All this, which Jason of Cyrene set forth in
detail in five volumes, we will try to condense into a single book. 
24
In view of the flood of statistics, and the
difficulties encountered by those who wish to plunge into historical narratives
where the material is abundant, 
25
we have aimed to please those who prefer simple
reading, as well as to make it easy for the studious who wish to commit things
to memory, and to be helpful to all. 
26
For us who have taken upon ourselves the labor
of making this digest, the task, far from being easy, is one of sweat and of
sleepless nights, 
27
just as the preparation of a festive banquet is
no light matter for one who thus seeks to give enjoyment to others. Similarly,
to win the gratitude of many we will gladly endure these inconveniences, 
28
while we leave the responsibility for exact
details to the original author, and confine our efforts to giving only a
summary outline. 
29
As the architect of a new house must give his
attention to the whole structure, while the man who undertakes the decoration
and the frescoes has only to concern himself with what is needed for
ornamentation, so I think it is with us. 
30
To enter into questions and examine them
thoroughly from all sides is the task of the professional historian; 
31
but the man who is making an adaptation should
be allowed to aim at brevity of expression and to omit detailed treatment of
the matter. 
32
Here, then, we shall begin our account without
further ado; it would be nonsense to write a long preface to a story and then
abbreviate the story itself.

 [1-8] This legendary accout of how
Jeremiah hid the sacred tent (which was not mentioned after the time of
Solomon!), the ark, and the altar is given for the purpose of explaining why
the postexilic temple was the legitimate place of worship even without these
sacred objects.
