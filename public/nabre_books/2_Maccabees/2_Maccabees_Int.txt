Introduction
Introduction
Although this book,
like the preceding one, receives its title from its protagonist, Judas Maccabee
(or Maccabeus), it is not a sequel to 1 Maccabees. The two differ in many
respects. Whereas the first covers the period from the beginning of the reign
of Antiochus IV (175 B.C.) to the accession of John Hyrcanus I (134 B.C.), this
present book treats of the events in Jewish history from the time of the high
priest Onias III and King Seleucus IV (c. 180 B.C.) to the defeat of Nicanor's
army (161 B.C.).
The author of 2 Maccabees
states (
⇒
 2 Macc 2:23) that his one-volume work is
an abridgment of a certain five-volume work by Jason of Cyrene; but since this
latter has not survived, it is difficult to determine its relationship to the
present epitome. One does not know how freely the anonymous epitomizer may have
rewritten his shorter composition, or how closely he may have followed the
wording of the original in the excerpts he made. Some parts of the text here,
clearly not derived from Jason's work, are the Preface (
⇒
 2
Macc 2:19-32), the Epilogue (
⇒
 2 Macc
15:37-39), and probably also certain moralizing reflections (e. g.,
⇒
 2 Macc 5:17-20; 
⇒
 6:12-17).
It is certain, however, that both works were written in Greek, which explains
why the Second Book of Maccabees was not included in the canon of the Hebrew
Bible.
The book is not without
genuine historical value in supplementing I Maccabees, and it contains some
apparently authentic documents (
⇒
 2 Macc
11:16-38). Its purpose, whether intended by Jason himself or read
into it by the compiler, is to give a theological interpretation to the history
of the period. There is less interest, therefore, in the actual exploits of
Judas Maccabeus than in God's marvelous interventions. These direct the course
of events, both to punish the sacriligeous and blashphemous pagans, and to
purify God's holy temple and restore it to his faithful people. The author
sometimes effects his purpose by transferring events from their proper
chronological order, and giving exaggerated figures for the size of armies and
the numbers killed in battle; he also places long, edifying discourses and prayers
in the mouths of his heroes, and inclines to elaborate descriptions of
celestial apparitions (
⇒
 2 Macc 3:24-34;
⇒
 5:2-4; 
⇒
 10:29,
⇒
 30; 
⇒
 15:11-16). He
is the earliest known composer of stories that glorify God's holy martyrs
(
⇒
 2 Macc 6:18-
⇒
 7:42;
⇒
 14:37-46).
Of theological importance
are the author's teachings on the resurrection of the just on the last day
(
⇒
 2 Macc 7:9, 
⇒
 11,
⇒
 14, 
⇒
 23;
⇒
 14:46), the intercession of the saints in heaven
for people living on earth (
⇒
 15:11-16), and the
power of the living to offer prayers and sacrifices for the dead
(
⇒
 12:39-46).
The beginning of 2
Maccabees consists of two letters sent by the Jews of Jerusalem to their
coreligionists in Egypt. They deal with the observance of the feast
commemorating the central event of the book, the purification of the temple. It
is uncertain whether the author or a later scribe prefixed these letters to the
narrative proper. If the author is responsible for their insertion, he must
have written his book some time after 124 B.C., the date of the more recent of
the two letters. In any case, Jason's five-volume work very likely continued
the history of the Jews well into the Hasmonean period, so that 2 Maccabees
would probably not have been produced much before the end of the second century
B.C.
