[1]
 About this time Antiochus sent his second
expedition into Egypt. 
2
It then happened that all over the city, for
nearly forty days, there appeared horsemen charging in midair, clad in garments
interwoven with gold - companies fully armed with lances 
3
and drawn swords; squadrons of cavalry in
battle array, charges and countercharges on this side and that, with brandished
shields and bristling spears, flights of arrows and flashes of gold ornaments,
together with armor of every sort. 
4
Therefore all prayed that this vision might be
a good omen. 
5
[2]
 But when a false rumor circulated that
Antiochus was dead, Jason gathered fully a thousand men and suddenly attacked
the city. As the defenders on the walls were forced back and the city was
finally being taken, Menelaus took refuge in the citadel. 
6
Jason then slaughtered his fellow citizens
without mercy, not realizing that triumph over one's own kindred was the
greatest failure, but imagining that he was winning a victory over his enemies,
not his fellow countrymen. 
7
Even so, he did not gain control of the
government, but in the end received only disgrace for his treachery, and once
again took refuge in the country of the Ammonites. 
8
[3]
 At length he met a miserable end. Called to
account before Aretas, king of the Arabs, he fled from city to city, hunted by
all men, hated as a transgressor of the laws, abhorred as the butcher of his
country and his countrymen. After being driven into Egypt, 
9
he crossed the sea to the Spartans, among whom
he hoped to find protection because of his relations with them. There he who
had exiled so many from their country perished in exile; 
10
and he who had cast out so many to lie unburied
went unmourned himself with no funeral of any kind or any place in the tomb of
his ancestors. 
11
When these happenings were reported to the
king, he thought that Judea was in revolt. Raging like a wild animal, he set
out from Egypt and took Jerusalem by storm. 
12
He ordered his soldiers to cut down without
mercy those whom they met and to slay those who took refuge in their houses. 
13
There was a massacre of young and old, a
killing of women and children, a slaughter of virgins and infants. 
14
In the space of three days, eighty thousand
were lost, forty thousand meeting a violent death, and the same number being
sold into slavery. 
15
Not satisfied with this, the king dared to
enter the holiest temple in the world; Menelaus, that traitor both to the laws
and to his country, served as guide. 
16
He laid his impure hands on the sacred vessels
and gathered up with profane hands the votive offerings made by other kings for
the advancement, the glory, and the honor of the Place. 
17
Puffed up in spirit, Antiochus did not realize
that it was because of the sins of the city's inhabitants that the Lord was
angry for a little while and hence disregarded the holy Place. 
18
If they had not become entangled in so many
sins, this man, like Heliodorus, who was sent by King Seleucus to inspect the
treasury, would have been flogged and turned back from his presumptuous action
as soon as he approached. 
19
[4]
 The Lord, however, had not chosen the people
for the sake of the Place, but the Place for the sake of the people. 
20
Therefore, the Place itself, having shared in
the people's misfortunes, afterward participated in their good fortune; and
what the Almighty had forsaken in his anger was restored in all its glory, once
the great Sovereign became reconciled. 
21
Antiochus carried off eighteen hundred talents
from the temple, and hurried back to Antioch. In his arrogance he planned to
make the land navigable and the sea passable on foot, so carried away was he
with pride. 
22
[5]
 But he left governors to harass the nation: at
Jerusalem, Philip, a Phrygian by birth, and in character more cruel than the
man who appointed him; 
23
[6]
 at Mount Gerizim, Andronicus; and besides
these, Menelaus, who lorded it over his fellow citizens worse than the others
did. Out of hatred for the Jewish citizens, 
24
[7]
 the king sent Appollonius, commander of the
Mysians, at the head of an army of twenty-two thousand men, with orders to kill
all the grown men and sell the women and young men into slavery. 
25
When this man arrived in Jerusalem, he
pretended to be peacefully disposed and waited until the holy day of the
sabbath; then, finding the Jews refraining from work, he ordered his men to
parade fully armed. 
26
All those who came out to watch, he massacred,
and running through the city with armed men, he cut down a large number of
people. 
27
But Judas Maccabeus and about nine others
withdrew to the wilderness, where he and his companions lived like wild animals
in the hills, continuing to eat what grew wild to avoid sharing the defilement.

army to Palestine (

the first invasion. The author of 2 Macc apparently combines the first pillage
