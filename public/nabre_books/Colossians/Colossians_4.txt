1
Masters, treat your slaves justly and fairly,
realizing that you too have a Master in heaven. 
2
Persevere in prayer, being watchful in it with
thanksgiving; 
3
at the same time, pray for us, too, that God
may open a door to us for the word, to speak of the mystery of Christ, for
which I am in prison, 
4
that I may make it clear, as I must speak. 
5
Conduct yourselves wisely toward outsiders,
making the most of the opportunity. 
6
Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned
with salt, so that you know how you should respond to each one. 
7
[1]
 Tychicus, 
[2]
 my beloved brother,
trustworthy minister, and fellow slave in the Lord, will tell you all the news
of me. 
8
I am sending him to you for this very purpose,
so that you may know about us and that he may encourage your hearts, 
9
together with Onesimus, a trustworthy and
beloved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you about everything here. 
10
Aristarchus, 
[3]
 my fellow
prisoner, sends you greetings, as does Mark the cousin of Barnabas (concerning
whom you have received instructions; if he comes to you, receive him), 
11
and Jesus, 
[4]
 who is called
Justus, who are of the circumcision; these alone are my co-workers for the
kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me. 
12
Epaphras 
[5]
 sends you
greetings; he is one of you, a slave of Christ (Jesus), always striving for you
in his prayers so that you may be perfect and fully assured in all the will of
God. 
13
For I can testify that he works very hard for
you and for those in Laodicea 
[6]
 and those in Hierapolis. 
14
Luke 
[7]
 the beloved physician
sends greetings, as does Demas. 
15
Give greetings to the brothers in Laodicea and
to Nympha and to the church in her house. 
[8]
16
And when this letter is read before you, have
it read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and you yourselves read the one
from Laodicea. 
[9]
17
And tell Archippus, "See that you fulfill
the ministry 
[10]
 that you received in the Lord." 
18
The greeting is in my own hand, 
[11]
Paul's. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. 
1
 [7-18] Paul concludes with
greetings and information concerning various Christians known to the
Colossians.
2
 [7] Tychicus:
⇒
 Acts 20:4 mentions his role in the collection for
Jerusalem; 
⇒
 Eph 6:21 repeats what is said here; see
also 
⇒
 2 Tim 4:12; 
⇒
 Titus
3:12. 
3
 [10] Aristarchus: a Thessalonian
who was with Paul at Ephesus and Caesarea and on the voyage to Rome
(
⇒
 Acts 19:29; 
⇒
 20:4;
⇒
 27:2). Mark: also referred to at
⇒
 Philippians 1:24 and 
⇒
 2 Tim
4:11 and, as "John Mark," in Acts (
⇒
 Acts
12:12, 
⇒
 25;
⇒
 13:13; 
⇒
 15:37-40).
See also 
⇒
 1 Peter 5:13 and the note there.
Traditionally the author of the second gospel.
4
 [11] Jesus: a then common Jewish
name, the Greek form of Joshua.
5
 [12] Epaphras: see the notes on
⇒
 Col 1:3-8 and 
⇒
 Col 1:7.
6
 [13] Laodicea: see the note on
⇒
 Col 2:1. Hierapolis: a city northeast of Laodicea
and northwest of Colossae.
7
 [14] Luke: only here described as a
medical doctor; cf 
⇒
 Philippians 1:24 and
⇒
 2 Tim 4:11. Traditionally the author of the third
gospel. Demas: cf 
⇒
 Philippians 1:24; he later
deserted Paul (
⇒
 2 Tim 4:10).
8
 [15] Nympha and . . . her house:
some manuscripts read a masculine for the house-church leader, "Nymphas
and . . . his house."
9
 [16] The one from Laodicea: either
a letter by Paul that has been lost or the Letter to the Ephesians (cf the note
on 
⇒
 Eph 1:1 in Ephesus).
10
 [17] Fulfill the ministry: usually
taken to mean that Archippus, the son of Philemon and Apphia
(
⇒
 Philippians 1:1-2), is "pastor" at
Colossae. An alternate interpretation is that Archippus, not Philemon, is the
owner of the slave Onesimus and that Paul is asking Archippus to complete the
service he has received in the Lord by sending Onesimus back to minister to
Paul in his captivity (cf 
⇒
 Philippians 1:20).
11
 [18] My own hand: a postscript in
Paul's own hand was his custom; cf 
⇒
 Gal 6:11-18 and
⇒
 2 Thes 3:17-18.
