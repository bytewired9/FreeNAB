 If then you were raised with Christ, seek what
is above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. 
2
Think of what is above, not of what is on
earth. 
3
For you have died, and your life is hidden with
Christ in God. 
4
When Christ your life appears, then you too
will appear with him in glory. 
5
[2]
 Put to death, then, the parts of you that are
earthly: immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and the greed that is idolatry.
[3]
6
Because of these the wrath of God 
[4]
is coming (upon the disobedient). 
7
By these you too once conducted yourselves,
when you lived in that way. 
8
But now you must put them all away: 
[5]
anger, fury, malice, slander, and obscene language out of your mouths. 
9
Stop lying to one another, since you have taken
off the old self with its practices 
10
[6]
 and have put on the new self, which is being
renewed, for knowledge, in the image of its creator. 
11
Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision
and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, 
[7]
 slave, free; but
Christ is all and in all. 
12
Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and
beloved, heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience, 
13
bearing with one another and forgiving one
another, if one has a grievance against another; as the Lord has forgiven you,
so must you also do. 
14
And over all these put on love, that is, the
bond of perfection. 
15
And let the peace of Christ control your
hearts, the peace into which you were also called in one body. And be thankful.
16
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, as
in all wisdom you teach and admonish one another, singing psalms, hymns, and
spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God. 
17
And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do
everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father
through him. 
18
[8]
 Wives, be subordinate to your husbands, as is
proper in the Lord. 
19
Husbands, love your wives, and avoid any
bitterness toward them. 
20
Children, obey your parents in everything, for
this is pleasing to the Lord. 
21
Fathers, do not provoke your children, so they
may not become discouraged. 
22
Slaves, 
[9]
 obey your human
masters in everything, not only when being watched, as currying favor, but in
simplicity of heart, fearing the Lord. 
23
Whatever you do, do from the heart, as for the
Lord and not for others, 
24
knowing that you will receive from the Lord the
due payment of the inheritance; be slaves of the Lord Christ. 
25
For the wrongdoer will receive recompense for
the wrong he committed, and there is no partiality.

 [1-4] By retaining the message of
the gospel that the risen, living Christ is the source of their salvation, the
Colossians will be free from false religious evaluations of the things of the
world (
⇒
 Col 3:1-2). They have died to these; but one
day when Christ . . . appears, they will live with Christ in the presence of
God (
⇒
 Col 3:3-4). 
2
 [5-17] In lieu of false asceticism
and superstitious festivals, the apostle reminds the Colossians of the moral
life that is to characterize their response to God through Christ. He urges
their participation in the liturgical hymns and prayers that center upon God's
plan of salvation in Christ (
⇒
 Col 3:16).

 [8-10] Put . . . away; have taken
off; have put on: the terms may reflect baptismal practice, taking off garments
and putting on new ones after being united with Christ, here translated into ethical
terms.

 4:6] After general
recommendations that connect family life and the social condition of slavery
with the service of Christ (
⇒
 Col
3:18-
⇒
 4:1), Paul requests prayers for
himself, especially in view of his imprisonment (
⇒
 Col
3:2-3), and recommends friendly relations and meaningful discussions
of Christian teaching with outsiders, i.e., non-Christians
(

 Col 3:5-6). See the note on

 [22-25] Slaves: within this table
of duties in family and societal relations, involving wives and husbands,
children and parents (
⇒
 Col 3:18-21), such as also
appears in 
⇒
 Eph
5:22-
⇒
 6:9, slaves here receive special
attention because of the case of Onesimus the slave returning to his master
(
⇒
 Col 4:9; 
⇒
 Philemon
1:10-12).
