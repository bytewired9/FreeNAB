1
Then his son Judas, who was called Maccabeus,
took his place. 
2
All his brothers and all who had joined his
father supported him, and they carried on Israel's war joyfully. 
3
He spread abroad the glory of his people, and
put on his breastplate like a giant. He armed himself with weapons of war; he
planned battles and protected the camp with his sword. 
4
In his actions he was like a lion, like a young
lion roaring for prey. 
5
He pursued the wicked, hunting them out, and those
who troubled his people he destroyed by fire. 
6
The lawbreakers were cowed by fear of him, and
all evildoers were dismayed. By his hand redemption was happily achieved, 
7
and he afflicted many kings; He made Jacob glad
by his deeds, and his memory is blessed forever. 
8
He went about the cities of Judah destroying
the impious there. He turned away wrath from Israel 
9
and was renowned to the ends of the earth; he
gathered together those who were perishing. 
10
[1]
 Then Apollonius gathered the Gentiles,
together with a large army from Samaria, to fight against Israel. 
11
When Judas learned of it, he went out to meet
him and defeated and killed him. Many fell wounded, and the rest fled. 
12
Their possessions were seized and the sword of
Apollonius was taken by Judas, who fought with it the rest of his life. 
13
But Seron, commander of the Syrian army, heard
that Judas had gathered many about him, an assembly of faithful men ready for
war. 
14
So he said, "I will make a name for myself
and win glory in the kingdom by defeating Judas and his followers, who have
despised the king's command." 
15
And again a large company of renegades advanced
with him to help him take revenge on the Israelites. 
16
[2]
 When he reached the ascent of Beth-horon,
Judas went out to meet him with a few men. 
17
But when they saw the army coming against them,
they said to Judas: "How can we, few as we are, fight such a mighty host
as this? Besides, we are weak today from fasting." 
18
But Judas said: "It is easy for many to be
overcome by a few; in the sight of Heaven there is no difference between
deliverance by many or by few; 
19
for victory in war does not depend upon the
size of the army, but on strength that comes from Heaven. 
20
With great presumption and lawlessness they
come against us to destroy us and our wives and children and to despoil us; 
21
but we are fighting for our lives and our laws.
22
[3]
 He himself will crush them before us; so do
not be afraid of them." 
23
When he finished speaking, he rushed suddenly
upon Seron and his army, who were crushed before him. 
24
[4]
 He pursued Seron down the descent of
Beth-horon into the plain. About eight hundred of their men fell, and the rest
fled to the country of the Philistines. 
25
Then Judas and his brothers began to be feared,
and dread fell upon the Gentiles about them. 
26
His fame reached the king, and all the Gentiles
talked about the battles of Judas. 
27
When Antiochus heard about these events, he was
angry; so he ordered a muster of all the forces of his kingdom, a very strong
army. 
28
He opened his treasure chests, gave his
soldiers a year's pay, and commanded them to be prepared for anything. 
29
He then found that this exhausted the money in
his treasury; moreover the income from the province was small, because of the
dissension and distress he had brought upon the land by abolishing the laws
which had been in effect from of old. 
30
He feared that, as had happened more than once,
he would not have enough for his expenses and for the gifts that he had
previously given with a more liberal hand than the preceding kings. 
31
Greatly perplexed, he decided to go to Persia
and levy tribute on those provinces, and so raise a large sum of money. 
32
He left Lysias, a nobleman of royal blood, in
charge of the king's affairs from the Euphrates River to the frontier of Egypt,
33
and commissioned him to take care of his son
Antiochus until his own return. 
34
He entrusted to him half of the army, and the
elephants, and gave him instructions concerning everything he wanted done. As
for the inhabitants of Judea and Jerusalem, 
35
Lysias was to send an army against them to
crush and destroy the power of Israel and the remnant of Jerusalem and efface
their memory from the land. 
36
He was to settle foreigners in all their
territory and distribute their land by lot. 
37
[5]
 The king took the remaining half of the army
and set out from Antioch, his capital, in the year one hundred and forty-seven;
he crossed the Euphrates River and advanced inland. 
38
[6]
 Lysias chose Ptolemy, son of Dorymenes, and
Nicanor and Gorgias, capable men among the King's Friends, 
39
and with them he sent forty thousand men and
seven thousand cavalry to invade the land of Judah and ravage it according to
the king's orders. 
40
[7]
 Setting out with all their forces, they came
and pitched their camp near Emmaus in the plain. 
41
When the merchants of the country heard of
their fame, they came to the camp, bringing fetters and a large sum of silver
and gold, to buy the Israelites as slaves. A force from Idumea and from
Philistia joined with them. 
42
Judas and his brothers saw that the situation
had become critical now that armies were encamped within their territory; they
knew of the orders which the king had given to destroy and utterly wipe out the
people. 
43
So they said to one another, "Let us
restore our people from their ruined estate, and fight for our people and our
sanctuary!" 
44
The assembly gathered together to prepare for
battle and to pray and implore mercy and compassion. 
45
Jerusalem was uninhabited, like a desert; not
one of her children entered or came out. The sanctuary was trampled on, and
foreigners were in the citadel; it was a habitation of Gentiles. Joy had
disappeared from Jacob, and the flute and the harp were silent. 
46
[8]
 Thus they assembled and went to Mizpah near
Jerusalem, because there was formerly at Mizpah a place of prayer for Israel. 
47
That day they fasted and wore sackcloth; they
sprinkled ashes on their heads and tore their clothes. 
48
[9]
 They unrolled the scroll of the law, to learn
about the things for which the Gentiles consulted the images of their idols. 
49
[10]
 They brought with them the priestly vestments,
the first fruits, and the tithes; and they brought forward the nazirites who
had completed the time of their vows. 
50
And they cried aloud to Heaven: "What
shall we do with these men, and where shall we take them? 
51
For your sanctuary has been trampled on and
profaned, and your priests are in mourning and humiliation. 
52
Now the Gentiles are gathered together against
us to destroy us. You know what they plot against us. 
53
How shall we be able to resist them unless you
help us?" 
54
Then they blew the trumpets and cried out
loudly. 
55
After this Judas appointed officers among the
people, over thousands, over hundreds, over fifties, and over tens. 
56
He proclaimed that those who were building
houses, or were just married, or were planting vineyards, and those who were
afraid, could each return to his home, according to the law. 
57
Then the army moved off, and they camped to the
south of Emmaus. 
58
Judas said: "Arm yourselves and be brave;
in the morning be ready to fight these Gentiles who have assembled against us
to destroy us and our sanctuary. 
59
It is better for us to die in battle than to
witness the ruin of our nation and our sanctuary. Whatever Heaven wills, he
will do."
