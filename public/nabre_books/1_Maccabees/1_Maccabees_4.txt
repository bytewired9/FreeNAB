1
Now Gorgias took five thousand infantry and a
thousand picked cavalry, and this detachment set out at night 
2
in order to attack the camp of the Jews and
take them by surprise. Some men from the citadel were their guides. 
3
Judas heard of it, and himself set out with his
soldiers to attack the king's army at Emmaus, 
4
while the latter's forces were still scattered
away from the camp. 
5
During the night Gorgias came into the camp of
Judas, and found no one there; so he began to hunt for them in the mountains,
saying, "They are fleeing from us." 
6
But at daybreak Judas appeared in the plain
with three thousand men, who lacked such armor and swords as they would have
wished. 
7
They saw the army of the Gentiles, strong and
breastplated, flanked with cavalry, and made up of expert soldiers. 
8
Judas said to the men with him: "Do not be
afraid of their numbers or dread their attack. 
9
Remember how our fathers were saved in the Red
Sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with an army. 
10
So now let us cry to Heaven in the hope that he
will favor us, remember his covenant with our fathers, and destroy this army
before us today. 
11
All the Gentiles shall know that there is One
who redeems and delivers Israel." 
12
When the foreigners looked up and saw them
marching toward them, 
13
they came out of their camp for battle, and the
men with Judas blew the trumpet. 
14
The battle was joined and the Gentiles were
defeated and fled toward the plain. 
15
[1]
 Their whole rearguard fell by the sword, and
they were pursued as far as Gazara and the plains of Judea, to Azotus and
Jamnia. About three thousand of their men fell. 
16
When Judas and the army returned from the
pursuit, 
17
he said to the people: "Do not be greedy
for the plunder, for there is a fight ahead of us, 
18
and Gorgias and his army are near us on the
mountain. But now stand firm against our enemies and overthrow them. Afterward
you can freely take the plunder." 
19
As Judas was finishing this speech, a
detachment appeared, looking down from the mountain. 
20
They saw that their army had been put to flight
and their camp was being burned. The smoke that could be seen indicated what
had happened. 
21
When they realized this, they were terrified;
and when they also saw the army of Judas in the plain ready to attack, 
22
[2]
 they all fled to Philistine territory. 
23
Then Judas went back to plunder the camp, and his
men collected much gold and silver, violet and crimson cloth, and great
treasure. 
24
As they returned, they were singing hymns and
glorifying Heaven, "for he is good, for his mercy endures forever." 
25
Thus Israel had a great deliverance that day. 
26
But those of the foreigners who had escaped
went and told Lysias all that had occurred. 
27
When he heard it he was disturbed and
discouraged, because things in Israel had not turned out as he intended and as
the king had ordered. 
28
So the following year he gathered together
sixty thousand picked men and five thousand cavalry, to subdue them. 
29
[3]
 They came into Idumea and camped at Beth-zur,
and Judas met them with ten thousand men. 
30
Seeing that the army was strong, he prayed
thus: "Blessed are you, O Savior of Israel, who broke the rush of the
mighty one by the hand of your servant David and delivered the camp of the
Philistines into the hand of Jonathan, the son of Saul, and his armor-bearer. 
31
Give this army into the hands of your people
Israel; make them ashamed of their troops and their cavalry. 
32
Strike them with fear, weaken the boldness of
their strength, and let them tremble at their own destruction. 
33
Strike them down by the sword of those who love
you, that all who know your name may hymn your praise." 
34
Then they engaged in battle, and about five
thousand of Lysias' men fell in hand-to-hand fighting. 
35
[4]
 When Lysias saw his ranks beginning to give
way, and the increased boldness of Judas, whose men were ready either to live
or to die bravely, he withdrew to Antioch and began to recruit mercenaries so
as to return to Judea with greater numbers. 
36
[5]
 Then Judas and his brothers said, "Now
that our enemies have been crushed, let us go up to purify the sanctuary and
rededicate it." 
37
So the whole army assembled, and went up to
Mount Zion. 
38
They found the sanctuary desolate, the altar
desecrated, the gates burnt, weeds growing in the courts as in a forest or on
some mountain, and the priests' chambers demolished. 
39
Then they tore their clothes and made great
lamentation; they sprinkled their heads with ashes 
40
and fell with their faces to the ground. And
when the signal was given with trumpets, they cried out to Heaven. 
41
Judas appointed men to attack those in the
citadel, while he purified the sanctuary. 
42
He chose blameless priests, devoted to the law;
43
these purified the sanctuary and carried away
the stones of the Abomination to an unclean place. 
44
They deliberated what ought to be done with the
altar of holocausts that had been desecrated. 
45
The happy thought came to them to tear it down,
lest it be a lasting shame to them that the Gentiles had defiled it; so they
tore down the altar. 
46
They stored the stones in a suitable place on
the temple hill, until a prophet should come and decide what to do with them. 
47
Then they took uncut stones, according to the
law, and built a new altar like the former one. 
48
They also repaired the sanctuary and the
interior of the temple and purified the courts. 
49
They made new sacred vessels and brought the
lampstand, the altar of incense, and the table into the temple. 
50
Then they burned incense on the altar and
lighted the lamps on the lampstand, and these illuminated the temple. 
51
They also put loaves on the table and hung up
curtains. Thus they finished all the work they had undertaken. 
52
[6]
 Early in the morning on the twenty-fifth day
of the ninth month, that is, the month of Chislev, in the year one hundred and
forty-eight, 
53
they arose and offered sacrifice according to
the law on the new altar of holocausts that they had made. 
54
On the anniversary of the day on which the
Gentiles had defiled it, on that very day it was reconsecrated with songs,
harps, flutes, and cymbals. 
55
All the people prostrated themselves and adored
and praised Heaven, who had given them success. 
56
For eight days they celebrated the dedication of
the altar and joyfully offered holocausts and sacrifices of deliverance and
praise. 
57
They ornamented the facade of the temple with
gold crowns and shields; they repaired the gates and the priests' chambers and
furnished them with doors. 
58
There was great joy among the people now that
the disgrace of the Gentiles was removed. 
59
[7]
 Then Judas and his brothers and the entire
congregation of Israel decreed that the days of the dedication of the altar
should be observed with joy and gladness on the anniversary every year for
eight days, from the twenty-fifth day of the month Chislev. 
60
At that time they built high walls and strong
towers around Mount Zion, to prevent the Gentiles from coming and trampling
over it as they had done before. 
61
Judas also placed a garrison there to protect
it, and likewise fortified Beth-zur, that the people might have a stronghold
facing Idumea.
