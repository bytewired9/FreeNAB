Introduction
The name
Maccabee, probably meaning "hammer," is actually applied in the Books
of Maccabees to only one man, Judas, third son of the priest Mattathias and first
leader of the revolt against the Seleucid kings who persecuted the Jews
(
⇒
 1 Macc 2:4, 
⇒
 66;
⇒
 2 Macc 8:5, 
⇒
 16;
⇒
 10:1, 
⇒
 16).
Traditionally the name has come to be applied to the brothers of Judas, his
supporters, and even to other Jewish heroes of the period, such as the seven
brothers (2 Macc 7).
The two Books of Maccabees,
placed last in the Douai version of the Old Testament, contain independent
accounts of events in part identical which accompanied the attempted
suppression of Judaism in Palestine in the second century B.C. The vigorous
reaction to this attempt established for a time the religious and political
independence of the Jews.
1 Maccabees was written
about 100 B.C., in Hebrew, but the original has not come down to us. Instead,
we have an early, pre-Christian, Greek translation full of Hebrew idioms. The
author, probably a Palestinian Jew, is unknown. He was familiar with the
traditions and sacred books of his people and had access to much reliable
information on their recent history (from 175 to 134 B.C.). He may well have
played some part in it himself in his youth. His purpose in writing is to
record the salvation of Israel which God worked through the family of
Mattathias (
⇒
 1 Macc 5:62)-especially through his
three sons, Judas, Jonathan, and Simon, and his grandson, John Hyrcanus.
Implicitly the writer compares their virtues and their exploits with those of
the ancient heroes, the Judges, Samuel, and David.
There are seven poetic
sections in the book which imitate the style of classical Hebrew poetry: four
laments (
⇒
 1 Macc 1:25-28,
⇒
 36-40; 
⇒
 2:8-13;
⇒
 3:45), and three hymns of praise of "our
fathers" (
⇒
 1 Macc 2:51-64), of Judas
(
⇒
 1 Macc 3:3-9), and of Simon
(
⇒
 1 Macc 14:4-15). The doctrine expressed in the
book is the customary belief of Israel, without the new developments which
appear in 2 Maccabees and Daniel. The people of Israel have been specially
chosen by the one true God as his covenant-partner, and they alone are
privileged to know him and worship him. He is their eternal benefactor and
their unfailing source of help. The people, in turn, must be loyal to his
exclusive worship and must observe exactly the precepts of the law he has given
them.
There is no doctrine of
individual immortality except in the survival of one's name and fame, nor does
the book express any messianic expectation, though messianic images are applied
historically to "the days of Simon" (
⇒
 2 Macc
14:4-17). In true deuteronomic tradition, the author insists on
fidelity to the law as the expression of Israel's love for God. The contest
which he describes is a struggle, not simply between Jew and Gentile, but
between those who would uphold the law and those, Jews or Gentiles, who would
destroy it. His severest condemnation goes, not to the Seleucid politicians,
but to the lawless apostates among his own people, adversaries of Judas and his
brothers, who are models of faith and loyalty.
1 Maccabees has importance
also for the New Testament. Salvation is paralleled with Jewish national
aspirations (
⇒
 1 Macc
4:46-
⇒
 14:41), in contrast to the universal
reign of God taught by Christ in the Gospel (
⇒
 Matthew
13:47-50; 
⇒
 22:1-14). Also, destruction of
the wall of the temple separating Jew from Gentile is an act of desecration in
⇒
 1 Macc 9:54 but in 
⇒
 Eph
2:14, an act of redemption and unification of both through Christ. On
the other hand, association, in 
⇒
 1 Macc 2:52, of
Abraham's offering up of Isaac (Gen 22) with his justification by God
(
⇒
 Genesis 15:6) is reflected in
⇒
 John 2:21, 
⇒
 22 just as
the Scriptures are regarded as a source of consolation in 
⇒
 1
Macc 12:9 and in 
⇒
 Romans 15:4.
The Books of Maccabees,
though regarded by Jews and Protestants as apocryphal, i.e., not inspired
Scripture, because not contained in the Palestinian Canon or list of books
drawn up at the end of the first century A.D., have nevertheless always been
accepted by the Catholic Church as inspired, on the basis of apostolic
tradition.
