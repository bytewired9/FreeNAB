[1]
 In the year one hundred and fifty-one,
Demetrius, son of Seleucus, set out from Rome, arrived with a few men in a city
on the seacoast, and began to rule there. 
2
As he was preparing to enter the royal palace
of his ancestors, the soldiers seized Antiochus and Lysias to bring them to
him. 
3
When he was informed of this, he said, "Do
not show me their faces." 
4
So the soldiers killed them, and Demetrius sat
on the royal throne. 
5
[2]
 Then all the lawless and impious men of Israel
came to him. They were led by Alcimus, who desired to be high priest. 
6
They made this accusation to the king against
the people: "Judas and his brothers have destroyed all your friends and
have driven us out of our country. 
7
So now, send a man whom you trust to go and see
all the havoc Judas has done to us and to the king's land, and let him punish
them and all their supporters." 
8
Then the king chose Bacchides, one of the
King's Friends, governor of West-of-Euphrates, a great man in the kingdom, and
faithful to the king. 
9
He sent him and the impious Alcimus, to whom he
granted the high priesthood, with orders to take revenge on the Israelites. 
10
They set out and, on arriving in the land of
Judah with a great army, sent messengers who spoke deceitfully to Judas and his
brothers in peaceful terms. 
11
But these paid no attention to their words,
seeing that they had come with a great army. 
12
A group of scribes, however, gathered about
Alcimus and Bacchides to ask for a just agreement. 
13
The Hasideans were the first among the
Israelites to seek peace with them, 
14
for they said, "A priest of the line of
Aaron has come with the army, and he will not do us any wrong." 
15
He spoke with them peacefully and swore to
them, "We will not try to injure you or your friends." 
16
So they trusted him. But he arrested sixty of
them and killed them in one day, according to the text of Scripture: 
17
"The flesh of your saints they have
strewn, and their blood they have shed round about Jerusalem, and there was no
one to bury them." 
18
Then fear and dread of them came upon all the
people, who said: "There is no truth or justice among them; they violated
the agreement and the oath that they swore." 
19
[3]
 Bacchides withdrew from Jerusalem and pitched
his camp in Beth-zaith. He had many of the men arrested who deserted to him,
throwing them into the great pit. 
20
He handed the province over to Alcimus, leaving
troops to help him, while he himself returned to the king. 
21
Alcimus spared no pains to maintain his high
priesthood, 
22
and all those who were disturbing their people
gathered about him. They took possession of the land of Judah and caused great
distress in Israel. 
23
When Judas saw all the evils that Alcimus and
his men were bringing upon the Israelites, more than even the Gentiles had
done, 
24
he went about all the borders of Judea and took
revenge on the men who had deserted, preventing them from going out into the
country. 
25
But when Alcimus saw that Judas and his
followers were gaining strength and realized that he could not oppose them, he
returned to the king and accused them of grave crimes. 
26
Then the king sent Nicanor, one of his famous
officers, who was a bitter enemy of Israel, with orders to destroy the people. 
27
[4]
 Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a large force
and deceitfully sent to Judas and his brothers this peaceable message: 
28
"Let there be no fight between me and you.
I will come with a few men to meet you peaceably." 
29
So he came to Judas, and they greeted one
another peaceably. But Judas' enemies were prepared to seize him. 
30
When he became aware that Nicanor had come to
him with treachery in mind, Judas was afraid and would not meet him again. 
31
[5]
 When Nicanor saw that his plan had been
discovered, he went out to fight Judas near Capharsalama. 
32
About five hundred men of Nicanor's army fell;
the rest fled to the City of David. 
33
After this, Nicanor went up to Mount Zion. Some
of the priests from the sanctuary and some of the elders of the people came out
to greet him peaceably and to show him the holocaust that was being offered for
the king. 
34
[6]
 But he mocked and ridiculed them, defiled
them, and spoke disdainfully. 
35
In a rage he swore: "If Judas and his army
are not delivered to me at once, when I return victorious I will burn this
temple down." He went away in great anger. 
36
The priests, however, went in and stood before
the altar and the sanctuary. They wept and said: 
37
"You have chosen this house to bear your
name, to be a house of prayer and petition for your people. 
38
Take revenge on this man and his army, and let
them fall by the sword. Remember their blasphemies, and do not let them
continue." 
39
Nicanor left Jerusalem and pitched his camp at
Beth-horon, where the Syrian army joined him. 
40
[7]
 But Judas camped in Adasa with three thousand
men. Here Judas uttered this prayer: 
41
"When they who were sent by the king
blasphemed, your angel went out and killed a hundred and eighty-five thousand
of them. 
42
In the same way, crush this army before us
today, and let the rest know that Nicanor spoke wickedly against your
sanctuary; judge him according to his wickedness." 
43
The armies met in battle on the thirteenth day
of the month Adar. Nicanor's army was crushed, and he himself was the first to
fall in the battle. 
44
When his army saw that Nicanor was dead, they
threw down their arms and fled. 
45
The Jews pursued them a day's journey, from
Adasa to near Gazara, blowing the trumpets behind them as signals. 
46
From all the surrounding villages of Judea
people came out and closed in on them. They hemmed them in, and all the enemies
fell by the sword; not a single one escaped. 
47
Then the Jews collected the spoils and the
booty; they cut off Nicanor's head and his right arm, which he had lifted up so
arrogantly. These they brought to Jerusalem and displayed there. 
48
The people rejoiced greatly, and observed that
day as a great festival. 
49
[8]
 They decreed that it should be observed every
year on the thirteenth of Adar. 
50
[9]
 And for a short time the land of Judah was
quiet. 
1
 [1-3] The year one hundred and
fifty-one: the spring of 161 B.C. Demetrius, son of Seleucus, was the lawful
heir to the kingdom; but when only nine years old, he was taken as a hostage at
Rome in place of his uncle, who ruled as Antiochus IV Epiphanes. At the age of
twenty-five Demetrius fled secretly from Rome and, with the support of the
Syrians, overcame his rival Antiochus V and put him to death. The royal palace:
at Antioch. 
2
 [5-6] Alcimus: a renegade Jew
hostile to the Maccabees, who became high priest after the death of Menelaus
(
⇒
 2 Macc 14:3). He received confirmation in his
office from the new King Demetrius (
⇒
 2 Macc 7:9),
and brought malicious charges against Judas and his brothers and the people
(
⇒
 2 Macc 7:6). He wrought more evils on the
Israelites than the Gentiles had done (
⇒
 2 Macc
8:23).
3
 [19] Beth-zaith: about three miles
north of Beth-zur and twelve miles south of Jerusalem.
4
 [27] Nicanor . . . deceitfully sent
to Judas: a more favorable picture of Nicanor, as an honest man who became a
personal friend of Judas, is given in 
⇒
 2 Macc
14:17-25. Their friendship was broken by the intrigues of Alcimus
(
⇒
 2 Macc 14:26-30).
5
 [31] Caphar-salama: a village seven
miles north-northwest of Jerusalem, on the road leading to Beth-horon.
6
 Defiled them: spitting on the
priests caused them to become legally defiled.
7
 [40] Adasa: a village southeast of
Caphar-salama.
8
 [49] The thirteenth of Adar: March
27, 160 B.C. This day in the Jewish calendar was called the "Day of
Nicanor" (
⇒
 2 Macc 15:36), but it was not
long celebrated by the Jews.
9
 [50] A short time: about one month
following the death of Nicanor. After that began the attack of Bacchides
resulting in the death of Judas (
⇒
 1 Macc 9:1-18).
