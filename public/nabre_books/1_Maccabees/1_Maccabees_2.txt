[1]
 In those days Mattathias, son of John, son of
Simeon, a priest of the family of Joarib, left Jerusalem and settled in Modein.
2
He had five sons: John, who was called Gaddi; 
3
Simon, who was called Thassi; 
4
Judas, who was called Maccabeus; 
5
Eleazar, who was called Avaran; and Jonathan,
who was called Apphus. 
6
When he saw the sacrileges that were being
committed in Judah and in Jerusalem, 
7
he said: "Woe is me! Why was I born to see
the ruin of my people and the ruin of the holy city, and to sit idle while it
is given into the hands of enemies, and the sanctuary into the hands of
strangers? 
8
"Her temple has become like a man
disgraced, 
9
her glorious ornaments have been carried off as
spoils, Her infants have been murdered in her streets, her young men by the
sword of the enemy. 
10
What nation has not taken its share of her
realm, and laid its hand on her possessions? 
11
All her adornment has been taken away. From
being free, she has become a slave. 
12
We see our sanctuary and our beauty and our
glory laid waste, And the Gentiles have defiled them! 
13
Why are we still alive?" 
14
Then Mattathias and his sons tore their
garments, put on sackcloth, and mourned bitterly. 
15
The officers of the king in charge of enforcing
the apostasy came to the city of Modein to organize the sacrifices. 
16
Many of Israel joined them, but Mattathias and
his sons gathered in a group apart. 
17
Then the officers of the king addressed
Mattathias: "You are a leader, an honorable and great man in this city,
supported by sons and kinsmen. 
18
[2]
[3]
 Come now, be the first to
obey the king's command, as all the Gentiles and the men of Judah and those who
are left in Jerusalem have done. Then you and your sons shall be numbered among
the King's Friends, and shall be enriched with silver and gold and many
gifts." 
19
But Mattathias answered in a loud voice:
"Although all the Gentiles in the king's realm obey him, so that each
forsakes the religion of his fathers and consents to the king's orders, 
20
yet I and my sons and my kinsmen will keep to
the covenant of our fathers. 
21
God forbid that we should forsake the law and
the commandments. 
22
We will not obey the words of the king nor depart
from our religion in the slightest degree." 
23
As he finished saying these words, a certain
Jew came forward in the sight of all to offer sacrifice on the altar in Modein
according to the king's order. 
24
When Mattathias saw him, he was filled with
zeal; his heart was moved and his just fury was aroused; he sprang forward and
killed him upon the altar. 
25
At the same time, he also killed the messenger
of the king who was forcing them to sacrifice, and he tore down the altar. 
26
Thus he showed his zeal for the law, just as
Phinehas did with Zimri, son of Salu. 
27
Then Mattathias went through the city shouting,
"Let everyone who is zealous for the law and who stands by the covenant
follow after me!" 
28
Thereupon he fled to the mountains with his
sons, leaving behind in the city all their possessions. 
29
[4]
 Many who sought to live according to
righteousness and religious custom went out into the desert to settle there, 
30
they and their sons, their wives and their
cattle, because misfortunes pressed so hard on them. 
31
It was reported to the officers and soldiers of
the king who were in the City of David, in Jerusalem, that certain men who had
flouted the king's order had gone out to the hiding places in the desert. 
32
Many hurried out after them, and having caught
up with them, camped opposite and prepared to attack them on the sabbath. 
33
"Enough of this!" the pursuers said
to them. "Come out and obey the king's command, and your lives will be
spared." 
34
But they replied, "We will not come out,
nor will we obey the king's command to profane the sabbath." 
35
Then the enemy attacked them at once; 
36
but they did not retaliate; they neither threw
stones, nor blocked up their own hiding places. 
37
They said, "Let us all die without
reproach; heaven and earth are our witnesses that you destroy us
unjustly." 
38
So the officers and soldiers attacked them on
the sabbath, and they died with their wives, their children and their cattle,
to the number of a thousand persons. 
39
When Mattathias and his friends heard of it,
they mourned deeply for them. 
40
"If we all do as our kinsmen have
done," they said to one another, "and do not fight against the
Gentiles for our lives and our traditions, they will soon destroy us from the
earth." 
41
On that day they came to this decision:
"Let us fight against anyone who attacks us on the sabbath, so that we may
not all die as our kinsmen died in the hiding places." 
42
[5]
 Then they were joined by a group of Hasideans,
valiant Israelites, all of them devout followers of the law. 
43
And all those who were fleeing from the
disaster joined them and supported them. 
44
They gathered an army and struck down sinners
in their anger and lawbreakers in their wrath, and the survivors fled to the
Gentiles for safety. 
45
Mattathias and his friends went about and tore
down the pagan altars; 
46
they also enforced circumcision for any
uncircumcised boys whom they found in the territory of Israel. 
47
They put to flight the arrogant, and the work
prospered in their hands. 
48
They saved the law from the hands of the
Gentiles and of the kings and did not let the sinner triumph. 
49
When the time came for Mattathias to die, he
said to his sons: "Arrogance and scorn have now grown strong; it is a time
of disaster and violent anger. 
50
Therefore, my sons, be zealous for the law and
give your lives for the covenant of our fathers. 
51
"Remember the deeds that our fathers did
in their times, and you shall win great glory and an everlasting name. 
52
Was not Abraham found faithful in trial, and it
was reputed to him as uprightness? 
53
Joseph, when in distress, kept the commandment,
and he became master of Egypt. 
54
Phinehas our father, for his burning zeal,
received the covenant of an everlasting priesthood. 
55
Joshua, for executing his commission, became a
judge in Israel. 
56
Caleb, for bearing witness before the assembly,
received an inheritance in the land. 
57
David, for his piety, received as a heritage a
throne of everlasting royalty. 
58
Elijah, for his burning zeal for the law, was
taken up to heaven. 
59
Hananiah, Azariah and Mishael, for their faith,
were saved from the fire. 
60
Daniel, for his innocence, was delivered from
the jaws of lions. 
61
And so, consider this from generation to
generation, that none who hope in him shall fail in strength. 
62
Do not fear the words of a sinful man, for his
glory ends in corruption and worms. 
63
Today he is exalted, and tomorrow he is not to
be found, because he has returned to his dust, and his schemes have perished. 
64
Children! be courageous and strong in keeping
the law, for by it you shall be glorified. 
65
"Here is your brother Simeon who I know is
a wise man; listen to him always, and he will be a father to you. 
66
And Judas Maccabeus, a warrior from his youth,
shall be the leader of your army and direct the war against the nations. 
67
You shall also gather about you all who observe
the law, and you shall avenge the wrongs of your people. 
68
Pay back the Gentiles what they deserve, and
observe the precepts of the law." 
69
Then he blessed them, and he was united with
his fathers. 
70
[6]
 He died in the year one hundred and forty-six,
and was buried in the tombs of his fathers in Modein, and all Israel mourned
him greatly.
