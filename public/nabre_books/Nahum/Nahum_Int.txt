Introduction
Shortly before
the fall of Nineveh in 612 B.C., Nahum uttered his prophecy against the hated
city. To understand the prophet's exultant outburst of joy over the impending
destruction it is necessary to recall the savage cruelty of Assyria, which had
made it the scourge of the ancient Near East for almost three centuries. The
royal inscriptions of Assyria afford the best commentary on the burning
denunciation of "the bloody city."' In the wake of their conquests,
mounds of heads, impaled bodies, enslaved citizens, and avaricious looters
testified to the ruthlessness of the Assyrians. Little wonder that Judah joined
in the general outburst of joy over the destruction of Nineveh!
But Nahum is not a prophet
of unrestrained revenge. God's moral government of the world is asserted.
Yahweh is the avenger but he is also merciful, a citadel in the day of
distress. Nineveh's doom was a judgment on the wicked city. Before many years
passed, Jerusalem too was to learn the meaning of such a judgment.
