Introduction
Zechariah's
initial prophecy is dated to 520 B.C., the same year as that in which Haggai
received the prophetic call. The first eight chapters of the Book of Zechariah
contain oracles which certainly belong to him while the last six (sometimes
called "Deutero-Zechariah") represent the work of one or more unknown
authors. In the prophecies proper to Zechariah eight symbolic visions are
recorded, all meant to promote the work of rebuilding the temple and to
encourage the returned exiles, especially their leaders, Joshua and Zerubbabel.
In the final chapter of this first division Zechariah portrays the messianic
future under the figure of a prosperous land to which the nations come in
pilgrimage, eager to follow the God of Israel.
The second part of
Zechariah is divided into two sections, each with its own introductory title.
The first (Zec 9-11) consists of oracles whose historical background, date and
authorship are extremely difficult to determine. With
â‡’
 Zechariah 9:9 begins the messianic vision of the
coming of the Prince of Peace. The verses describing the triumphant appearance
of the humble king are taken up by the four Evangelists to describe the entry
of Christ into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. Zec 12 is introduced by an oracle
proclaiming the victory of God's people over the heathen. The prophecy closes
by describing in apocalyptic imagery, the final assault of the enemy on
Jerusalem, after which the messianic age begins.
