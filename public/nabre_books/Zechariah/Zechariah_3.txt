Then he showed me Joshua the high priest
standing before the angel of the LORD, while Satan stood at his right hand to
accuse him. 
2
And the angel of the LORD said to Satan,
"May the LORD rebuke you, Satan; may the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem
rebuke you! Is not this man a brand snatched from the fire?" 
3
[1]
 Now Joshua was standing before the angel, clad
in filthy garments. 
4
He spoke and said to those who were standing
before him, "Take off his filthy garments, and clothe him in festal
garments." 
5
He also said, "Put a clean miter on his
head." And they put a clean miter on his head and clothed him with the
garments. Then the angel of the LORD, standing, said, "See, I have taken
away your guilt." 
6
The angel of the LORD then gave Joshua this
assurance: 
7
"Thus says the LORD of hosts: If you walk
in my ways and heed my charge, you shall judge my house and keep my courts, and
I will give you access among these standing here. 
8
[2]
 Listen, O Joshua, high priest! You and your
associates who sit before you are men of good omen. Yes, I will bring my
servant the Shoot. 
9
[3]
 Look at the stone that I have placed before
Joshua, one stone with seven facets. I will engrave its inscription, says the
LORD of hosts, and I will take away the guilt of the land in one day. 
10
On that day, says the LORD of hosts, you will
invite one another under your vines and fig trees."

 [3] Filthy garments: symbolic of
mourning for the dead, or of national catastrophe, and implying acknowledgment
of guilt (

 Zechariah 3:5). 
2
 [8] Men of good omen: the
restoration of the priesthood is a sign of the coming of the messianic times.
My servant the Shoot: identified, in the earliest form of
⇒
 Zechariah 6:11-12 as the prophet composed it, with
Zerubbabel, direct descendant of King David and rebuilder of the temple; and,
as such, a type of the Messiah; cf 
⇒
 Jeremiah 23:5.
3
 [9] One stone with seven facets:
apparently the same as the select stone of 
⇒
4:7(10) which seems to be a precious gem. The seven facets are
explained in 
⇒
 Zechariah 4:7(10) as signifying the
Lord's vigilance over the world. I will engrave its inscription: the same
Hebrew verb for engrave is used in 
⇒
 Exodus 28:9,
⇒
 11 in regard to the inscriptions on the twelve
precious stones of the priestly breastpiece.
