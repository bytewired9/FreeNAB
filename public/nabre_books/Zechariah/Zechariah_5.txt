 Then I raised my eyes again and saw a scroll
flying. 
2
"What do you see?" he asked me. I
answered, "I see a scroll flying; it is twenty cubits long and ten cubits
wide." 
3
Then he said to me: "This is the curse
which is to go forth over the whole earth; in accordance with it shall every
thief be swept away, and in accordance with it shall every perjurer be expelled
from here. 
4
I will send it forth, says the LORD of hosts,
and it shall come into the house of the thief, or into the house of him who
perjures himself with my name; it shall lodge within his house, consuming it,
timber and stones." 
5
[2]
 Then the angel who spoke with me came forward
and said to me, "Raise your eyes and see what this is that comes
forth." 
6
"What is it?" I asked. And he
answered, "This is a bushel container coming. This is their guilt in all
the land." 
7
Then a leaden cover was lifted, and there was a
woman sitting inside the bushel. 
8
"This is Wickedness," he said; and he
thrust her inside the bushel, pushing the leaden cover into the opening. 
9
Then I raised my eyes and saw two women coming
forth with a wind ruffling their wings, for they had wings like the wings of a
stork. As they lifted up the bushel into the air, 
10
I said to the angel who spoke with me,
"Where are they taking the bushel?" 
11
He replied, "To build a temple for it in
the land of Shinar; when the temple is ready, they will deposit it there in its
place."

 [1-4] The enormous scroll, thirty
feet by fifteen (the dimensions in length and breadth of the portico of
Solomon's temple, 
⇒
 1 Kings 6:3), contains a list of
maledictions on sinners, similar to that in 
⇒
 Deut
27:15-26. The thief and the perjurer represent all sinners, who are
expelled from the holy community.

 [5-11] The woman sealed in the
bushel container is a figure of the general corruption of the people of Judah.
She is removed from the Holy Land and transported to Shinar, that is,
Babylonia, where a dwelling is being prepared for her; this is a symbol of the
reign of Wickedness in pagan lands, contrasted with the reign of holiness in
the Lord's dwelling on Mount Zion.
