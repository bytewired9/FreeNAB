 Paul, an apostle not from
human beings nor through a human being but through Jesus Christ and God the
Father who raised him from the dead, 
2
[3]
 and all the brothers who are with me, to the
churches of Galatia: 
3
grace to you and peace from God our Father and
the Lord Jesus Christ, 
4
[4]
 who gave himself for our sins that he might
rescue us from the present evil age in accord with the will of our God and
Father, 
5
to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen. 
6
[5]
[6]
 I am amazed that you are
so quickly forsaking the one who called you by (the) grace (of Christ) for a
different gospel 
7
(not that there is another). But there are some
who are disturbing you and wish to pervert the gospel of Christ. 
8
But even if we or an angel from heaven should
preach (to you) a gospel other than the one that we preached to you, let that
one be accursed! 
[7]
9
As we have said before, and now I say again, if
anyone preaches to you a gospel other than the one that you received, let that
one be accursed! 
10
Am I now currying favor with human beings or
God? Or am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people,
I would not be a slave of Christ. 
[8]
11
[9]
 Now I want you to know, brothers, that the
gospel preached by me is not of human origin. 
12
For I did not receive it from a human being,
nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ. 
[10]
13
[11]
 For you heard of my former way of life in
Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy
it, 
14
and progressed in Judaism beyond many of my
contemporaries among my race, since I was even more a zealot for my ancestral
traditions. 
15
But when (God), who from my mother's womb had
set me apart and called me through his grace, was pleased 
16
to reveal his Son to me, so that I might
proclaim him to the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult flesh and blood, 
[12]
17
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were
apostles before me; rather, I went into Arabia 
[13]
 and then
returned to Damascus. 
18
[14]
[15]
 Then after three years I
went up to Jerusalem to confer with Kephas and remained with him for fifteen
days. 
19
But I did not see any other of the apostles,
only James the brother of the Lord. 
[16]
20
(As to what I am writing to you, behold, before
God, I am not lying.) 
21
Then I went into the regions of Syria and
Cilicia. 
22
And I was unknown personally to the churches of
Judea that are in Christ; 
23
they only kept hearing that "the one who
once was persecuting us is now preaching the faith he once tried to
destroy." 
24
So they glorified God because of me.

 [1-5] See the note on
⇒
 Romans 1:1-7, concerning the greeting.
2
 [1] Apostle: because of attacks on
his authority in Galatia, Paul defends his apostleship. He is not an apostle
commissioned by a congregation (
⇒
 Philippians 2:25;
⇒
 2 Cor 8:23) or even by prophets
(
⇒
 1 Tim 1:18; 
⇒
 4:14)
but through Jesus Christ and God the Father. 
3
 [2] All the brothers: fellow
believers in Christ, male and female; cf 
⇒
 Gal
3:27-28. Paul usually mentions the co-sender(s) at the start of a
letter, but the use of all is unique, adding weight to the letter. Galatia:
central Turkey more likely than the Roman province of Galatia; see
Introduction.
4
 [4] The greeting in v 3 is expanded
by a christological formula that stresses deliverance through the Lord Jesus
from a world dominated by Satan; cf 
⇒
 2 Cor 4:4;
⇒
 Eph 2:2; 
⇒
 6:12.
5
 [6-10] In place of the usual
thanksgiving (see the note on 
⇒
 Romans 1:8), Paul,
with little to be thankful for in the Galatian situation, expresses amazement
at the way his converts are deserting the gospel of Christ for a perverted
message. He reasserts the one gospel he has preached (
⇒
 Gal
1:7-9) and begins to defend himself (
⇒
 Gal 1:10).
6
 [6] The one who called you: God or
Christ, though in actuality Paul was the divine instrument to call the
Galatians.
7
 [8] Accursed: in Greek, anathema;
cf 
⇒
 Romans 9:3; 
⇒
 1 Cor 12:3;
⇒
 16:22.
8
 [10] This charge by Paul's
opponents, that he sought to conciliate people with flattery and to curry favor
with God, might refer to his mission practices (cf 
⇒
 1 Cor
9:19-23) but the word still suggests it refers to his pre-Christian
days (cf 
⇒
 Gal 1:14; 
⇒
 Philippians
3:6). The self-description slave of Christ is one Paul often uses in
a greeting (
⇒
 Romans 1:1).
9
[11-
⇒
 2:21] Paul's presentation on behalf of his
message and of his apostleship reflects rhetorical forms of his day: he first
narrates the facts about certain past events (
⇒
 Gal
1:12-
⇒
 2:14) and then states his
contention regarding justification by faith as the gospel message
(
⇒
 Gal 2:15-21). Further arguments follow from both
experience and scripture in Gal 3; 4 before he draws out the ethical
consequences (
⇒
 Gal
5:1-
⇒
 6:10). The specific facts that he
takes up here to show that his gospel is not a human invention
(
⇒
 Gal 1:11) but came through a revelation of Jesus
Christ (
⇒
 Gal 1:12) deal with his own calling as a
Christian missionary (
⇒
 Gal 1:13-17), his initial
relations with the apostles in Jerusalem (
⇒
 Gal 1:18-24),
a later journey to Jerusalem (
⇒
 Gal 2:1-10), and an
incident in Antioch involving Kephas and persons from James
(
⇒
 Gal 2:11-14). The content of Paul's revealed
gospel is then set forth in the heart of the letter (
⇒
 Gal
2:15-21).
10
 [12] Although Paul received his
gospel through a revelation from Christ, this did not exclude his use of early
Christian confessional formulations. See the note on 
⇒
 Gal
1:4.
11
 [13-17] Along with
⇒
 Philippians 3:4-11, which also moves from
autobiography to its climax in a discussion on justification by faith (cf
⇒
 Gal 2:15-21), this passage is Paul's chief account
of the change from his former way of life (
⇒
 Gal
1:13) to service as a Christian missionary (
⇒
 Gal
1:16); cf 
⇒
 Acts 9:1-22;
⇒
 22:4-16; 
⇒
 26:9-18.
Paul himself does not use the term "conversion" but stresses
revelation (
⇒
 Gal 1:12,
⇒
 16). In 
⇒
 Gal 1:15 his
language echoes the Old Testament prophetic call of Jeremiah. Unlike the
account in Acts (cf 
⇒
 Acts 22:4-16), the calling of
Paul here includes the mission to proclaim Christ to the Gentiles
(
⇒
 Gal 1:16).
12
 [16] Flesh and blood: human
authorities (cf 
⇒
 Matthew 16:17;
⇒
 1 Cor 15:50). Paul's apostleship comes from God
(
⇒
 Gal 1:1).
13
 [17] Arabia: probably the region of
the Nabataean Arabs, east and south of Damascus.
14
 [18-24] Paul's first journey to
Jerusalem as a Christian, according to Galatians (cf 
⇒
 Acts
9:23-31 and the note on 
⇒
 Acts 12:25). He
is quite explicit about contacts there, testifying under oath
(
⇒
 Gal 1:20). On returning to Syria (perhaps
specifically Damascus, cf 
⇒
 Gal 1:17) and Cilicia
(including his home town Tarsus, cf 
⇒
 Acts 9:30;
⇒
 22:3), Paul most likely engaged in missionary
work. He underscores the fact that Christians in Judea knew of him only by
reputation.
15
 [18] After three years: two years
and more, since Paul's call. To confer with Kephas may mean simply "pay a
visit" or more specifically "get information from" him about
Jesus, over a two-week period. Kephas: Aramaic name of Simon (Peter); cf
⇒
 Matthew 16:16-18 and the notes there.
16
 [19] James the brother of the Lord:
not one of the Twelve, but a brother of Jesus (see the note on
⇒
 Mark 6:3). He played an important role in the
Jerusalem church (see the note on 
⇒
 Gal 2:9), the
leadership of which he took over from Peter (
⇒
 Acts
12:17). Paul may have regarded James as an apostle.
