Introduction
Problems common
to the combined Books Ezra-Nehemiah have been pointed out in the Introduction
to the Book of Ezra. The achievements of the two men were complementary; each
helped to make it possible for Judaism to maintain its identity during the
difficult days of the Restoration. Nehemiah was the man of action who rebuilt
the walls of Jerusalem and introduced necessary administrative reforms. Ezra in
turn was the great religious reformer who succeeded in establishing the Torah
as the constitution of the returned community.
The biblical sources for
Nehemiah's life and work are the autobiographical portions scattered through
the book. They are called the "Memoirs of Nehemiah," and have been
used more extensively and effectively by "the Chronicler" than the
"Memoirs of Ezra." No competent scholar questions the authenticity of
Nehemiah's memoirs. From these and other sources, the picture emerges of a man
dedicated to the single purpose of the welfare of his people. Despite
temperamental shortcomings, Nehemiah was a man of good practical sense combined
with deep faith in God. In view of his selfless service to a community capable
of severely testing any leader, we can be indulgent toward his numerous appeals
to God to credit him with the work he had done. Nehemiah was a layman, and his
generous dedication of talents to the service of God and of God's people
remains an example of undiminished force for laymen today.
