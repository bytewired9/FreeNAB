The following are the priests and Levites who
returned with Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah,
Ezra, 
2
Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, 
3
Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, 
4
Iddo, Ginnethon, Abijah, 
5
Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, 
6
Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah, 
7
Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the
priestly heads and their brethren in the days of Jeshua. 
8
The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel,
Sherebiah, Judah, Mattaniah; the last-mentioned, together with his brethren,
was in charge of the hymns, 
9
while Bakbukiah and Unno and their brethren
ministered opposite them by turns. 
10
[1]
 Jeshua became the father of Joiakim, Joiakim
became the father of Eliashib, and Eliashib became the father of Joiada. 
11
Joiada became the father of Johanan, and
Johanan became the father of Jaddua. 
12
In the days of Joiakim these were the priestly family
heads: for Seraiah, Meraiah; for Jeremiah, Hananiah; 
13
for Ezra, Meshullam; for Amariah, Jehohanan; 
14
for Malluchi, Jonathan; for Shebaniah, Joseph; 
15
for Harim, Adna; for Meremoth, Helkai; 
16
for Iddo, Zechariah; for Ginnethon, Meshullam; 
17
for Abijah, Zichri; for Miamin, . . . ; for
Maadiah, Piltai; 
18
for Bilgah, Shammua; for Shemaiah, Jehonathan; 
19
and for Joiarib, Mattenai; for Jedaiah, Uzzi; 
20
for Sallu, Kallai; for Amok, Eber; 
21
for Hilkiah, Hashabiah; for Jedaiah, Nethanel. 
22
In the time of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and
Jaddua, the family heads of the priests were written down in the Book of
Chronicles, up until the reign of Darius the Persian. 
23
The sons of Levi: the family heads were written
down in the Book of Chronicles, up until the time of Johanan, the son of
Eliashib. 
24
The heads of the Levites were Hashabiah,
Sherebiah, Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel. Their brethren who stood opposite them to
sing praises and thanksgiving in fulfillment of the command of David, the man
of God, one section opposite the other, 
25
were Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah.Meshullam,
Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers. They kept watch over the storerooms at the
gates. 
26
All these lived in the time of Joiakim, son of Jeshua,
son of Jozadak (and in the time of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the
priest-scribe). 
27
[2]
 At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem,
the Levites were sought out wherever they lived and were brought to Jerusalem
to celebrate a joyful dedication with thanksgiving hymns and the music of
cymbals, harps, and lyres. 
28
The levitical singers gathered together from
the region about Jerusalem, from the villages of the Netophathites, 
29
from Beth-gilgal, and from the plains of Geba
and Azmaveth (for the singers had built themselves settlements about
Jerusalem). 
30
The priests and Levites first purified
themselves, then they purified the people, the gates, and the wall. 
31
I had the princes of Judah mount the wall, and
I arranged two great choirs. The first of these proceeded to the right, along
the top of the wall, in the direction of the Dung Gate, 
32
followed by Hoshaiah and half the princes of
Judah, 
33
along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
34
Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, 
35
priests with the trumpets, and also Zechariah,
son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of
Zaccur, son of Asaph, 
36
and his brethren Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai,
Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of
David, the man of God. (Ezra the scribe was at their head.) 
37
At the Spring Gate they went straight up by the
steps of the City of David and continued along the top of the wall above the
house of David until they came to the Water Gate on the east. 
38
The second choir proceeded to the left,
followed by myself and the other half of the princes of the people, along the
top of the wall past the Oven Tower as far as the Broad Wall, 
39
then past the Ephraim Gate (the New City Gate),
the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Hundred Tower, as far as the Sheep
Gate (and they came to a halt at the Prison Gate). 
40
The two choirs took up a position in the house
of God; I, too, who had with me half the magistrates, 
41
the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Minjamin,
Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah, with the trumpets, 
42
and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi,
Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers were heard under the
leadership of Jezrahiah. 
43
Great sacrifices were offered on that day, and
there was rejoicing over the great feast of the LORD in which they shared. The
women and the children joined in, and the rejoicing at Jerusalem could be heard
from afar off. 
44
[3]
 At that time men were appointed over the
chambers set aside for stores, offerings, first fruits, and tithes; in them
they were to collect from the fields of the various cities the portions legally
assigned to the priests and Levites. For Judah rejoiced in its appointed
priests and Levites 
45
who carried out the ministry of their God and
the ministry of purification (as did the singers and the gatekeepers) in
accordance with the prescriptions of David and of Solomon, his son. 
46
For the heads of the families of the singers
and the hymns of praise and thanksgiving to God came down from the days of
David and Asaph in times of old. 
47
Thus all Israel, in the days of Zerubbabel (and
in the days of Nehemiah), gave the singers and the gatekeepers their portions,
according to their daily needs. They made their consecrated offering to the
Levites, and the Levites made theirs to the sons of Aaron. 
1
 [10-11] Jeshua, the high priest when
Zerubbabel was governor, i.e., the last decades of the sixth century B.C.
(
⇒
 Haggai 1:1, 
⇒
 12,
⇒
 14; 
⇒
 2:2,
4). He was the grandfather of Eliashib, the high
priest at least in the early period of Nehemiah's governorship, i.e., 445-433
B.C. (
⇒
 Ezra 10:6; 
⇒
3:1, 
⇒
 20, 
⇒
 21;
⇒
 13:4, 7). Eliashib,
in turn, was the grandfather of Johanan, a grown man, if not yet a high priest,
at the time of Ezra, i.e., c. 400 B.C. (
⇒
 Ezra 10:6;
and note). According to Josephus (Antiquites XI, v), whose testimony here is
doubtful, Jaddua, son of Johanan, died as an old man about the time that
Alexander the Great died, i.e., 323 B.C. If this list of the postexilic high
priests, at least as far as Johanan, comes, as seems probable (cf
⇒
 Nehemiah 12:23), from the Chronicler himself and
not from a later scribe, it is of prime importance for dating the Chronicler's
work in the first decades of the fourth century B.C. 
2
 [27-43] The dedication of the wall
of Jerusalem took place, no doubt, soon after the restoration of the wall and
its gates had been completed. Therefore, this section is best read after
⇒
 Nehemiah 6:15.
3
 [44-47] This account of the
provisions made for the temple services is apparently a composition of the
Chronicler. At that time: a mere connective; no particular time is meant, but
the account fits best after that of the restoration of the temple
(
⇒
 Ezra 6:13-18) in the days of Zerubbabel
(
⇒
 Nehemiah 12:47). The gloss mentioning Nehemiah
is not in the ancient Greek version.
