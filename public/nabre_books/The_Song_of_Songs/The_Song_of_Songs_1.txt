B
[2]
 Let him kiss me with
kisses of his mouth!
More delightful is your love than wine! 
3
Your name spoken is a spreading perfume -
that is why the maidens love you. 
4
Draw me!-
D
 We will follow you eagerly!
B
 Bring me, O king, to your chambers.
D
 With you we rejoice and exult,
we extol your love; it is beyond wine:
how rightly you are loved! 
5
B
[3]
 I am as dark-but lovely,
O daughters of Jerusalem -
As the tents of Kedar,
as the curtains of Salma. 
6
[4]
 Do not stare at me because I am swarthy,
because the sun has burned me.
My brothers have been angry with me;
they charged me with the care of the vineyards:
my own vineyard I have not cared for. 
7
B
[5]
 Tell me, you whom my
heart loves,
where you pasture your flock,
where you give them rest at midday,
Lest I be found wandering
after the flocks of your companions. 
8
G
 If you do not know,
O most beautiful among women,
Follow the tracks of the flock
and pasture the young ones
near the shepherds' camps. 
9
G
[6]
 To the steeds of
Pharaoh's chariots
would I liken you, my beloved: 
10
Your cheeks lovely in pendants,
your neck in jewels. 
11
We will make pendants of gold for you,
and silver ornaments. 
12
B
[7]
 For the king's banquet
my nard gives forth its fragrance. 
13
[8]
 My lover is for me a sachet of myrrh
to rest in my bosom. 
14
[9]
 My lover is for me a cluster of henna
from the vineyards of Engedi. 
15
G
[10]
 Ah, you are beautiful,
my beloved,
ah, you are beautiful; your eyes are doves! 
16
B
[11]
 Ah, you are beautiful,
my lover -
yes, you are lovely.
Our couch, too, is verdant; 
17
the beams of our house are cedars,
our rafters, cypresses.

 [1] This title is actually the
first verse of chapter 1. 
2
[
⇒
 1:2-
⇒
 8:14] The
marginal letters indicate the speaker of the verses: B-Bride; D-Daughters of
Jerusalem; G-Bridegroom. In 
⇒
 Song 1:2-7 the bride
and the daughters address the bridegroom who appears here as a king, but more
often in the poem as a shepherd. King and shepherd are familiar figures of the
Lord in the Sacred Scriptures. Cf 
⇒
 Psalm 23:1;
⇒
 Isaiah 40:11; 
⇒
 John
10:1-16.
3
 [5] Daughters of Jerusalem: the
chorus whom the bride addresses and who ask her questions
(
⇒
 Song 5:9; 
⇒
 6:1) thus
developing action within the poem. Kedar: a Syrian desert region whose name
suggests blackness; tents were often made of black goat hair. Curtains: tent
coverings of Salma, a region close to Kedar.
4
 [6] Swarthy: tanned by the sun from
working in her brothers' vineyards. My own vineyard: the bride herself; cf
⇒
 Isaiah 5:1-7 where Israel is designated as the
vineyard and the Lord is the Lover.
5
 [7] Here and elsewhere in the Song
(
⇒
 Song 3:1; 
⇒
 5:8;
⇒
 6:1), the bride expresses her desire to be in the
company of her lover. These verses point to a certain tension in the poem. Only
at the end (
⇒
 Song 8:5-14) does mutual possession of
the lovers become final.
6
 [9-11] The bridegroom compares the
girl's beauty to the rich adornment of the royal chariot of Pharaoh.
7
 [12] Nard: a precious perfume, a
figure of the bride; cf 
⇒
 Song 4:14.
8
 [13] Myrrh: produced from aromatic
resin of balsam or roses.
9
 [14] Henna: a plant which bears
white scented flowers.
10
 [15] Doves: suggesting innocence
and charm.
11
 [16-17] Though the meeting place of
the lovers is but a shepherd's hut of green branches, it becomes a palace with
beams of cedar and rafters of cypress when adorned with their love.
