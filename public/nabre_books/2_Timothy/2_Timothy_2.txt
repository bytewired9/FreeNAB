[1]
 So you, my child, be strong in the grace that
is in Christ Jesus. 
2
And what you heard from me through many
witnesses entrust to faithful people who will have the ability to teach others
as well. 
3
Bear your share of hardship along with me like
a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 
4
To satisfy the one who recruited him, a soldier
does not become entangled in the business affairs of life. 
5
Similarly, an athlete cannot receive the winner's
crown except by competing according to the rules. 
6
The hardworking farmer ought to have the first
share of the crop. 
7
Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will
give you understanding in everything. 
8
[2]
 Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a
descendant of David: such is my gospel, 
9
for which I am suffering, even to the point of
chains, like a criminal. But the word of God is not chained. 
10
Therefore, I bear with everything for the sake
of those who are chosen, so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in
Christ Jesus, together with eternal glory. 
11
This saying is trustworthy: If we have died
with him we shall also live with him; 
12
if we persevere we shall also reign with him.
But if we deny him he will deny us. 
13
If we are unfaithful he remains faithful, for
he cannot deny himself. 
14
[3]
 Remind people of these things and charge them
before God 
[4]
 to stop disputing about words. This serves no
useful purpose since it harms those who listen. 
15
Be eager to present yourself as acceptable to
God, a workman who causes no disgrace, imparting the word of truth without
deviation. 
16
Avoid profane, idle talk, for such people will
become more and more godless, 
17
and their teaching will spread like gangrene.
Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 
18
who have deviated from the truth by saying that
(the) resurrection has already taken place and are upsetting the faith of some.
19
Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands,
bearing this inscription, "The Lord knows those who are his"; and,
"Let everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord avoid evil." 
20
In a large household there are vessels not only
of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for lofty and others for
humble use. 
21
If anyone cleanses himself of these things, he
will be a vessel for lofty use, dedicated, beneficial to the master of the
house, ready for every good work. 
22
So turn from youthful desires and pursue
righteousness, faith,love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord 
[5]
with purity of heart. 
23
Avoid foolish and ignorant debates, for you
know that they breed quarrels. 
24
A slave of the Lord should not quarrel, but
should be gentle with everyone, able to teach, tolerant, 
25
correcting opponents with kindness. It may be
that God will grant them repentance that leads to knowledge of the truth, 
26
[6]
 and that they may return to their senses out
of the devil's snare, where they are entrapped by him, for his will.

 [1-7] This passage manifests a
characteristic deep concern for safeguarding the faith and faithfully
transmitting it through trustworthy people (
⇒
 2 Tim
2:1-2; cf 
⇒
 2 Tim 1:14;
⇒
 1 Tim 6:20; 
⇒
 Titus 1:9).
Comparisons to the soldier's detachment, the athlete's sportsmanship, and the
farmer's arduous work as the price of recompense (
⇒
 2 Tim
2:4-6) emphasize the need of singleness of purpose in preaching the
word, even at the cost of hardship, for the sake of Christ
(
⇒
 2 Tim 2:3). 
2
 [8-13] The section begins with a
sloganlike summary of Paul's gospel about Christ (
⇒
 2 Tim
2:8) and concludes with what may be part of an early Christian hymn
(
⇒
 2 Tim 2:11b-12a; most exegetes include the rest
of 
⇒
 2 Tim 2:12 and all of 
⇒
 2
Tim 2:13 as part of the quotation). The poetic lines suggest that through
baptism Christians die spiritually with Christ and hope to live with him and
reign with him forever, but the Christian life includes endurance, witness, and
even suffering, as the final judgment will show and as Paul's own case makes
clear; while he is imprisoned for preaching the gospel (
⇒
 2
Tim 2:9), his sufferings are helpful to the elect for obtaining the
salvation and glory available in Christ (
⇒
 2 Tim
2:10), who will be true to those who are faithful and will disown
those who deny him (
⇒
 2 Tim 2:12-13).
3
 [14-19] For those who dispute about
mere words (cf 
⇒
 2 Tim 2:23-24) and indulge in
irreligious talk to the detriment of their listeners (
⇒
 2 Tim
2:16-19), see the notes on 
⇒
 1 Tim 1:3-7;
⇒
 6:20-21. Hymenaeus and Philetus
(
⇒
 2 Tim 2:17), while accepting the Christian's
mystical death and resurrection in Christ through baptism, claimed that
baptized Christians are already risen with Christ in this life and thus that
there is no future bodily resurrection or eternal glory to come. The first
quotation in 
⇒
 2 Tim 2:19 is from
⇒
 Numbers 16:5; the other quotation is from some
unidentified Jewish or Christian writing.
4
 [14] Before God: many ancient
manuscripts read "before the Lord."
5
 [22] Those who call on the Lord:
those who believe in Christ and worship him as Lord, i.e., Christians
(
⇒
 Acts 9:14-16.20-21; 
⇒
 Romans
10:12-13; cf 
⇒
 2 Tim 2:19, literally, "Everyone
who names the name of the Lord").

 [26] Some interpreters would render
this passage, "Thus they may come to their senses and, forced to do his
(i.e., God's) will, may escape the devil's trap." This interpretation of
the Greek is possible, but the one accepted in the text seems more likely.
