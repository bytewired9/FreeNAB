Introduction
The authorship and
date of this letter, as one of the Pastoral Epistles, are discussed in the
Introduction to the First Letter to Timothy.
The tone here is more
personal than in First Timothy, for this letter addresses Timothy in vivid
terms (
⇒
 2 Tim 1:6-14;
⇒
 2:1-13) and depicts Paul's courage and hope in the
face of discouragements late in the course of his apostolic ministry
(
⇒
 2 Tim 1:15-18;
⇒
 3:10-17; 
⇒
 4:9-18).
Indeed, the letter takes on the character of a final exhortation and testament
from Paul to the younger Timothy (
⇒
 2 Tim 4:1-8).
Paul is portrayed as a prisoner (
⇒
 2 Tim 1:8,
⇒
 16; 
⇒
 2:9) in Rome
(
⇒
 2 Tim 1:17), and there is a hint that Timothy
may be in Ephesus (
⇒
 2 Tim 2:17). The letter
reveals that, with rare exceptions, Christians have not rallied to Paul's
support (
⇒
 2 Tim 1:15-18) and takes a pessimistic
view of the outcome of his case (
⇒
 2 Tim 4:6). It
describes Paul as fully aware of what impends, looking to God, not to human
beings, for his deliverance (
⇒
 2 Tim 4:3-8,
⇒
 18). It recalls his mission days with Timothy
(
⇒
 2 Tim 1:3-5; cf 
⇒
 Acts
16:1-4). It points to his preaching of the gospel as the reason for
his imprisonment and offers Timothy, as a motive for steadfastness, his own
example of firmness in faith despite adverse circumstances
(
⇒
 2 Tim 1:6-14). The letter suggests that Timothy
should prepare others to replace himself as Paul has prepared Timothy to
replace him (
⇒
 2 Tim 2:1-2). Paul urges him not to
desist out of fear from preserving and spreading the Christian message
(
⇒
 2 Tim 2:3-7). It presents the resurrection of
Jesus and his messianic role as the heart of the gospel for which Paul has been
ready to lay down his life (
⇒
 2 Tim 2:8-9) and thus
not only to express his own conviction fully but to support the conviction of
others (
⇒
 2 Tim 2:10-13).
This letter, like the
preceding one, urges Timothy to protect the community from the inevitable
impact of false teaching (
⇒
 2 Tim 2:14-
⇒
 3:9),
without fear of the personal attacks that may result (
⇒
 2 Tim
3:10-13). It recommends that he rely on the power of the scriptures,
on proclamation of the word, and on sound doctrine (
⇒
 2 Tim
3:14-
⇒
 4:2), without being troubled by
those who do not accept him (
⇒
 2 Tim 4:3-5). The
letter poignantly observes in passing that Paul has need of his reading
materials and his cloak (
⇒
 2 Tim 4:13) and, what
will be best of all, a visit from Timothy.
On the theory of authorship
by Paul himself, Second Timothy appears to be the last of the three Pastoral
Epistles. The many scholars who argue that the Pastorals are products of the
Pauline school often incline toward Second Timothy as the earliest of the three
and the one most likely to have actual fragments of material from Paul himself.
The principal divisions of
the Second Letter to Timothy are the following:
I.          
Address
(
⇒
 2 Tim 1:1-5) 
II.          
Exhortations
to Timothy (
⇒
 2 Tim
1:6-
⇒
 2:13) 
III.          
Instructions
Concerning False Teaching (
⇒
 2 Tim 2:14-
⇒
 4:8)
IV.          
Personal
Requests and Final Greetings (
⇒
 2 Tim
4:9-22)
