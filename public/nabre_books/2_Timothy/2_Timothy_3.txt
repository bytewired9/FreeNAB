 But understand this: there will be terrifying
times in the last days. 
2
People will be self-centered and lovers of
money, proud, haughty, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful,
irreligious, 
3
callous, implacable, slanderous, licentious,
brutal, hating what is good, 
4
traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of
pleasure rather than lovers of God, 
5
as they make a pretense of religion but deny
its power. Reject them. 
6
For some of these slip into homes and make
captives of women weighed down by sins, led by various desires, 
7
always trying to learn but never able to reach
a knowledge of the truth. 
8
Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so
they also oppose the truth - people of depraved mind, unqualified in the faith.
9
But they will not make further progress, for
their foolishness will be plain to all, as it was with those two. 
10
[2]
 You have followed my teaching, way of life,
purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance, 
11
persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened
to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, persecutions that I endured. Yet from
all these things the Lord delivered me. 
12
In fact, all who want to live religiously in
Christ Jesus will be persecuted. 
13
But wicked people and charlatans will go from
bad to worse, deceivers and deceived. 
14
But you, remain faithful to what you have learned
and believed, because you know from whom you learned it, 
15
and that from infancy you have known (the)
sacred scriptures, which are capable of giving you wisdom for salvation through
faith in Christ Jesus.

 All scripture is inspired
by God and is useful for teaching, for refutation, for correction, and for
training in righteousness, 
17
so that one who belongs to God may be
competent, equipped for every good work.

 [1-9] The moral depravity and false
teaching that will be rampant in the last days are already at work
(
⇒
 2 Tim 3:1-5). The frivolous and superficial, too,
devoid of the true spirit of religion, will be easy victims of those who
pervert them by falsifying the truth (
⇒
 2 Tim
3:6-8), just as Jannes and Jambres, Pharaoh's magicians of Egypt
(
⇒
 Exodus 7:11-12, 
⇒
 22),
discredited the truth in Moses' time. Exodus does not name the magicians, but
the two names are widely found in much later Jewish, Christian, and even pagan
writings. Their origins are legendary.

 [10-17] Paul's example for Timothy
includes persecution, a frequent emphasis in the Pastorals. Timothy is to be
steadfast to what he has been taught and to scripture. The scriptures are the
source of wisdom, i.e., of belief in and loving fulfillment of God's word
revealed in Christ, through whom salvation is given.

 [16-17] Useful for teaching . . .
every good work: because as God's word the scriptures share his divine
authority. It is exercised through those who are ministers of the word.

 [16] All scripture is inspired by
God: this could possibly also be translated, "All scripture inspired by
God is useful for. . . ." In this classic reference to inspiration, God is
its principal author, with the writer as the human collaborator. Thus the scriptures
are the word of God in human language. See also
