 The words of David's son, Qoheleth, king in
Jerusalem: 
2
[2]
 Vanity of vanities, says Qoheleth, vanity of
vanities! All things are vanity! 
3
[3]
 What profit has man from all the labor which
he toils at under the sun? 
4
One generation passes and another comes, but
the world forever stays. 
5
The sun rises and the sun goes down; then it
presses on to the place where it rises. 
6
Blowing now toward the south, then toward the
north, the wind turns again and again, resuming its rounds. 
7
All rivers go to the sea, yet never does the
sea become full. To the place where they go, the rivers keep on going. 
8
[4]
 All speech is labored; there is nothing man
can say. The eye is not satisfied with seeing nor is the ear filled with
hearing. 
9
What has been, that will be; what has been
done, that will be done. Nothing is new under the sun. 
10
Even the thing of which we say, "See, this
is new!" has already existed in the ages that preceded us. 
11
[5]
 There is no remembrance of the men of old; nor
of those to come will there be any remembrance among those who come after them.
12
I, Qoheleth, was king over Israel in Jerusalem,
13
and I applied my mind to search and investigate
in wisdom all things that are done under the sun. A thankless task God has
appointed for men to be busied about. 
14
[6]
 I have seen all things that are done under the
sun, and behold, all is vanity and a chase after wind. 
15
What is crooked cannot be made straight, and
what is missing cannot be supplied. 
16
Though I said to myself, "Behold, I have
become great and stored up wisdom beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem, and
my mind has broad experience of wisdom and knowledge"; 
17
yet when I applied my mind to know wisdom and
knowledge, madness and folly, I learned that this also is a chase after wind. 
18
For in much wisdom there is much sorrow, and he
who stores up knowledge stores up grief.

 [11] Men remember nothing long, God
never forgets.

 [14] Chase after wind: futility,
like an attempt to corral the winds. Cf

12:2. The ancient versions understood "affliction of
spirit." These words are used to conclude sections of the discourse, as
far as

 Eccl 6:9.
