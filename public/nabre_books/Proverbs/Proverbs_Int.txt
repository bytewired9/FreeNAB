Introduction
The first word of
this book, MISHLE, has provided the title by which it is generally designated
in Jewish and Christian circles. The name "Proverbs," while not an
exact equivalent of MISHLE, describes the main contents satisfactorily, even
though it is hardly an adequate designation for such parts as
⇒
 Proverb 1:1-
⇒
 9:18 or
⇒
 Proverb 31:10-31. Among some early Christian
writers the book was also known by the name of "Wisdom," and in the
Roman Missal it was referred to as a "Book of Wisdom."
The Book of Proverbs is an
anthology of didactic poetry forming part of the sapiential literature of the
Old Testament. Its primary purpose, indicated in the first sentence
(
⇒
 Proverb 1:2, 3), is to
teach wisdom. It is thus directed particularly to the young and inexperienced
(
⇒
 Proverb 1:4); but also to those who desire
advanced training in wisdom (
⇒
 Proverb 1:5,
6). The wisdom which the book teaches, covers a
wide field of human and divine activity, ranging from matters purely secular to
most lofty moral and religious truths, such as God's omniscience (
⇒
 Proverb
5:21; 
⇒
 15:3-11), power
(
⇒
 Proverb 19:21;
⇒
 21:30), providence (
⇒
 Proverb
20:1-24), goodness (
⇒
 Proverb 15:29), and
the joy and strength resulting from abandonment to him
(
⇒
 Proverb 3:5; 
⇒
 16:20;
⇒
 18:10). The teaching of the entire book is placed
on a firm religious foundation by the principle that "the fear of the LORD
is the beginning of knowledge" (
⇒
 Proverb 1:7;
cf 
⇒
 Proverb 9:10).
To Solomon are explicitly
ascribed parts II and V of the book; he is the patron of Hebrew wisdom. Of Agur
(part VI) and Lemuel (part VIII), nothing further is known. Parts III and IV
are attributed to "the wise." The remaining parts are anonymous.
The manner of compilation
is conjectural. Parts II and V may have circulated first as independent
collections, compiled before the fall of Jerusalem, as the references to
Solomon (
⇒
 Proverb 10:1) and Hezekiah
(
⇒
 Proverb 25:1) suggest. Parts III, IV and VII
would seem to belong together as a third collection of a similar kind. The
author of the first nine chapters, a religious sage familiar with the earlier
sacred books, was the editor of the whole as we have it, probably in the early
part of the fifth century B.C.
Christ and the Apostles
often expressly quoted the Proverbs (
⇒
 John 7:38;
⇒
 Romans 12:20; 
⇒
 James
4:6) or repeated their teaching; compare 
⇒
 Luke
10:14, and 
⇒
 Proverb 25:7;
⇒
 1 Peter 4:8; 
⇒
 James
5:20 and 
⇒
 Proverb 10:12. The book has an
important place in the Latin and Greek liturgies.
