 The words of Agur, son of
Jakeh the Massaite: The pronouncement of mortal man: "I am not God; I am
not God, that I should prevail. 
2
Why, I am the most stupid of men, and have not
even human intelligence; 
3
Neither have I learned wisdom, nor have I the
knowledge of the Holy One. 
4
Who has gone up to heaven and come down again
-  who has cupped the wind in his hands?
Who has bound up the waters in a cloak - 
who has marked out all the ends of the earth? What is his name, what is
his son's name, if you know it?" 
5
Every word of God is tested; he is a shield to
those who take refuge in him. 
6
Add nothing to his words, lest he reprove you,
and you be exposed as a deceiver. 
7
Two things I ask of you, deny them not to me
before I die: 
8
Put falsehood and lying far from me, give me
neither poverty nor riches; (provide me only with the food I need;) 
9
Lest, being full, I deny you, saying, "Who
is the LORD?" Or, being in want, I steal, and profane the name of my God. 
10
Slander not a servant to his master, lest he
curse you, and you have to pay the penalty. 
11
[3]
 There is a group of people that curses its
father, and blesses not its mother. 
12
There is a group that is pure in its own eyes,
yet is not purged of its filth. 
13
There is a group - how haughty their eyes! how
overbearing their glance! 
14
There is a group whose incisors are swords,
whose teeth are knives, Devouring the needy from the earth, and the poor from
among men. 
15
[4]
 The two daughters of the leech are,
"Give, Give." Three things are never satisfied, four never say,
"Enough!" 
16
The nether world, and the barren womb; the
earth, that is never saturated with water, and fire, that never says,
"Enough!" 
17
The eye that mocks a father, or scorns an aged
mother, Will be plucked out by the ravens in the valley; the young eagles will
devour it. 
18
[5]
 Three things are too wonderful for me, yes,
four I cannot understand: 
19
The way of an eagle in the air, the way of a
serpent upon a rock, The way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man
with a maiden. 
20
[6]
 Such is the way of an adulterous woman: she
eats, wipes her mouth, and says, "I have done no wrong." 
21
Under three things the earth trembles, yes,
under four it cannot bear up: 
22
Under a slave when he becomes king, and a fool
when he is glutted with food; 
23
Under an odious woman when she is wed, and a maidservant
when she displaces her mistress. 
24
Four things are among the smallest on the
earth, and yet are exceedingly wise: 
25
Ants - a species not strong, yet they store up
their food in the summer; 
26
[7]
 Rock-badgers - a species not mighty, yet they
make their home in the crags; 
27
Locusts - they have no king, yet they migrate
all in array; 
28
Lizards - you can catch them with your hands,
yet they find their way into king's palaces. 
29
Three things are stately in their stride, yes,
four are stately in their carriage: 
30
The lion, mightiest of beasts, who retreats
before nothing; 
31
The strutting cock, and the he-goat, and the
king at the head of his people. 
32
[8]
 If you have foolishly been proud or
presumptuous - put your hand on your mouth; 
33
For the stirring of milk brings forth curds,
and the stirring of anger brings forth blood.

 [1-3] Agur wishes to stress man's
insignificance when he is compared to God; cf Job 38-39.
2
 [1] Agur: an unknown person.
Massaite: from Massa in northern Arabia, elsewhere referred to as an encampment
of the Ishmaelites (
⇒
 Genesis 25:14). But the word
may not be intended as a place name; it might signify "an oracle," "a
prophecy." 
3
 [11-14] Perverted people are here
classified as unfilial (
⇒
 Proverb 30:11),
self-righteous (
⇒
 Proverb 30:12), proud
(
⇒
 Proverb 30:13) and rapacious (
⇒
 Proverb
30:14).
4
 [15-17] The two daughters . . .
"Give, Give": the text is obscure but the sense seems to be that the
leech is insatiable in its desire for blood, just as desire for blood, just as
are the nether world for victims, the barren womb for offspring, the parched
earth for water, and fire for fuel (
⇒
 Proverb
30:16).
5
 [18-19] The soaring flight of the
eagle, the mysterious movement upon a rock of the serpent which has no feet,
the path of the ship through the trackless deep, and the marvelous procreation
of human life, excite great wonderment.
6
 [20] This verse portrays the
indifference of an adulterous woman who thinks there is no trace of her wicked
act.
7
 [26] Rock-badgers: cf note to
⇒
 Psalm 104:18.
8
 [32-33] The anger aroused by
overweening pride threatens an awesome punishment.
