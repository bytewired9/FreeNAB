[1]
 Be not emulous of evil men, and desire not to
be with them; 
2
For their hearts plot violence, and their lips
speak of foul play. 
3
By wisdom is a house built, by understanding is
it made firm; 
4
And by knowledge are its rooms filled with
every precious and pleasing possession. 
5
A wise man is more powerful than a strong man,
and a man of knowledge than a man of might; 
6
For it is by wise guidance that you wage your
war, and the victory is due to a wealth of counselors. 
7
[2]
 For a fool, to be silent is wisdom; not to
open his mouth at the gate. 
8
He who plots evil doing -  men call him an intriguer. 
9
Beyond intrigue and folly and sin, it is
arrogance that men find abominable. 
10
[3]
 If you remain indifferent in time of
adversity, your strength will depart from you. 
11
[4]
 Rescue those who are being dragged to death,
and from those tottering to execution withdraw not. 
12
If you say, "I know not this man!"
does not he who tests hearts perceive it? He who guards your life knows it, and
he will repay each one according to his deeds. 
13
If you eat honey, my son, because it is good,
if virgin honey is sweet to your taste; 
14
Such, you must know, is wisdom to your soul. If
you find it, you will have a future, and your hope will not be cut off. 
15
Lie not in wait against the home of the just
man, ravage not his dwelling place; 
16
[5]
 For the just man falls seven times and rises
again, but the wicked stumble to ruin. 
17
Rejoice not when your enemy falls, and when he
stumbles, let not your heart exult, 
18
Lest the LORD see it, be displeased with you,
and withdraw his wrath from your enemy. 
19
Be not provoked with evildoers, nor envious of
the wicked; 
20
For the evil man has no future, the lamp of the
wicked will be put out. 
21
[6]
 My son, fear the LORD and the king; have
nothing to do with those who rebel against them; 
22
For suddenly arises the destruction they send,
and the ruin from either one, who can measure? 
23
[7]
 These also are sayings of the wise: To show
partiality in judgment is not good. 
24
He who says to the wicked man, "You are
just" -  men will curse him, people
will denounce him; 
25
But those who convict the evildoer will fare
well, and on them will come the blessing of prosperity. 
26
[8]
 He gives a kiss on the lips who makes an
honest reply. 
27
[9]
 Complete your outdoor tasks, and arrange your
work in the field; afterward you can establish your house. 
28
Be not a witness against your neighbor without
just cause, thus committing folly with your lips. 
29
[10]
 Say not, "As he did to me, so will I do
to him; I will repay the man according to his deeds." 
30
I passed by the field of the sluggard, by the
vineyard of the man without sense; 
31
And behold! it was all overgrown with thistles;
its surface was covered with nettles, and its stone wall broken down. 
32
And as I gazed at it, I reflected; I saw and
learned the lesson: 
33
A little sleep, a little slumber, a little
folding of the arms to rest -  
34
Then will poverty come upon you like a
highwayman, and want like an armed man.
