[1]
 My son, forget not my teaching, keep in mind
my commands; 
2
For many days, and years of life, and peace,
will they bring you. 
3
Let not kindness and fidelity leave you; bind
them around your neck; 
4
Then will you win favor and good esteem before
God and man. 
5
Trust in the LORD with all your heart, on your
own intelligence rely not; 
6
In all your ways be mindful of him, and he will
make straight your paths. 
7
Be not wise in your own eyes, fear the LORD and
turn away from evil; 
8
This will mean health for your flesh and vigor
for your bones. 
9
Honor the LORD with your wealth, with first
fruits of all your produce; 
10
Then will your barns be filled with grain, with
new wine your vats will overflow. 
11
The discipline of the LORD, my son, disdain
not; spurn not his reproof; 
12
For whom the LORD loves he reproves, and he
chastises the son he favors. 
13
[2]
 Happy the man who finds wisdom, the man who
gains understanding! 
14
For her profit is better than profit in silver,
and better than gold is her revenue; 
15
[3]
 She is more precious than corals, and none of
your choice possessions can compare with her. 
16
Long life is in her right hand, in her left are
riches and honor; 
17
Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths
are peace; 
18
[4]
 She is a tree of life to those who grasp her,
and he is happy who holds her fast. 
19
The LORD by wisdom founded the earth,
established the heavens by understanding; 
20
[5]
 By his knowledge the depths break open, and
the clouds drop down dew. 
21
My son, let not these slip out of your sight:
keep advice and counsel in view; 
22
So will they be life to your soul, and an
adornment for your neck. 
23
Then you may securely go your way; your foot
will never stumble; 
24
When you lie down, you need not be afraid, when
you rest, your sleep will be sweet. 
35
Honor is the possession of wise men, but fools
inherit shame. 
25
[6]
[7]
 Be not afraid of sudden
terror, of the ruin of the wicked when it comes; 
26
For the LORD will be your confidence, and will
keep your foot from the snare. 
27
Refuse no one the good on which he has a claim
when it is in your power to do it for him. 
28
Say not to your neighbor, "Go, and come
again, tomorrow I will give," when you can give at once. 
29
Plot no evil against your neighbor, against him
who lives at peace with you. 
30
Quarrel not with a man without cause, with one
who has done you no harm. 
31
Envy not the lawless man and choose none of his
ways: 
32
To the LORD the perverse man is an abomination,
but with the upright is his friendship. 
33
The curse of the LORD is on the house of the
wicked, but the dwelling of the just he blesses; 
34
When he is dealing with the arrogant, he is
stern, but to the humble he shows kindness.

 [1-12] Many are the rewards for
fidelity and trust in God, and for diffidence of self
(
⇒
 Proverb 3:1-8). Cf 
⇒
 Deut
30:20; 
⇒
 Isaiah 38:19. The offering of
material things for divine worship is blessed by an increase of such goods
(
⇒
 Proverb 3:9-10). Even correction and chastisement
are a mark of God's love and favor (
⇒
 Proverb
3:11-12). 
2
 [13-24] Wisdom, or understanding,
is more valuable than silver and gold. Its fruit is long life, riches, honor
and happiness (
⇒
 Proverb 3:13-18). Even the creation
of the universe and its adornment (Genesis 1) were not done without wisdom
(
⇒
 Proverb 3:19-20). It is the life of the soul and
gives security in work and in repose (
⇒
 Proverb
3:21-24).
3
 [15] Corals: some precious stone
may be intended.
4
 [18] A tree of life: cf
⇒
 Proverb 11:30;
⇒
 13:12; 
⇒
 Genesis 2:9.
5
 [20] For the Hebrews, the depths
enclosed the great subterranean ocean; the rain and dew descended from the
celestial ocean above the firmament; cf 
⇒
 Genesis
1:6-10; 
⇒
 Job 26:8,
⇒
 12; 
⇒
 Psalm 18:15;
⇒
 24:2.
6
 [25-34] Serving God with confidence
in him (
⇒
 Proverb 3:25-26) requires serving one's
neighbor through kindness (
⇒
 Proverb 3:27- 28),
peace with the good (
⇒
 Proverb 3:29-31), no envy of
the wicked (
⇒
 Proverb 3:31), because the Lord's
friendship and kindness are with the just; his curse is with the wicked.

 [25] The ruin of the wicked: i.e.,
the ruin that comes upon the wicked.
