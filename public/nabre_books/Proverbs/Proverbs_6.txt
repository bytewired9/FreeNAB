 My son, if you have
become surety to your neighbor, given your hand in pledge to another, 
2
You have been snared by the utterance of your
lips, caught by the words of your mouth; 
3
So do this, my son, to free yourself, since you
have fallen into your neighbor's power: Go, hurry, stir up your neighbor! 
4
Give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your
eyelids; 
5
Free yourself as a gazelle from the snare, or
as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 
6
Go to the ant, O sluggard, study her ways and
learn wisdom; 
7
For though she has no chief, no commander or
ruler, 
8
She procures her food in the summer, stores up
her provisions in the harvest. 
9
How long, O sluggard, will you rest? when will
you rise from your sleep? 
10
[3]
 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little
folding of the arms to rest -  
11
Then will poverty come upon you like a highway
man, and want like an armed man. 
12
A scoundrel, a villain, is he who deals in
crooked talk. 
13
He winks his eyes, shuffles his feet, makes
signs with his fingers; 
14
He has perversity in his heart, is always
plotting evil, sows discord. 
15
Therefore suddenly ruin comes upon him; in an
instant he is crushed beyond cure. 
16
[4]
 There are six things the LORD hates, yes,
seven are an abomination to him; 
17
Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that
shed innocent blood; 
18
A heart that plots wicked schemes, feet that
run swiftly to evil, 
19
The false witness who utters lies, and he who
sows discord among brothers. 
20
[5]
 Observe, my son, your father's bidding, and
reject not your mother's teaching; 
21
Keep them fastened over your heart always, put
them around your neck; 
23
For the bidding is a lamp, and the teaching a
light, and a way to life are the reproofs of discipline; 
24
To keep you from your neighbor's wife, from the
smooth tongue of the adulteress. 
25
Lust not in your heart after her beauty, let
her not captivate you with her glance! 
26
[6]
 For the price of a loose woman may be scarcely
a loaf of bread, But if she is married, she is a trap for your precious life. 
27
Can a man take fire to his bosom, and his
garments not burned? 
28
Or can a man walk on live coals, and his feet
not be scorched? 
29
So with him who goes in to his neighbor's wife
-  none who touches her shall go
unpunished. 
30
Men despise not the thief if he steals to
satisfy his appetite when he is hungry; 
31
Yet if he be caught he must pay back sevenfold;
all the wealth of his house he may yield up. 
32
But he who commits adultery is a fool; he who
would destroy himself does it. 
33
A degrading beating will he get, and his
disgrace will not be wiped away; 
34
For vindictive is the husband's wrath, he will
have no pity on the day of vengeance; 
35
He will not consider any restitution, nor be
satisfied with the greatest gifts.

 [1-19] These verses interrupt the
discourse of chapters 
⇒
 Proverb 6:2-7, which should
be read apart from them; they contain four shorter proverbs akin to those in
Prov 30.

 [1] Given your hand in pledge:
literally, "struck your hands"; this was probably the legal method
for closing a contract.

 [10] This verse may be regarded as
the sluggard's reply or as a continuation of the remonstrance.

 [16-19] The seven vices symbolized
for the most part by bodily organs are pride, lying, murder, intrigue,
readiness to do evil, false witness, and the stirring up of discord.

training and the love of wisdom are an invaluable and constant help for the
young (

(

 [26] Some interpret the verse in a
progressive sense, i.e., to satisfy the increasing demands of a courtesan a man
is reduced to poverty; if the woman is married, even his very life is
endangered.
