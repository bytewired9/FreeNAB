[1]
 Therefore, since Christ suffered in the flesh,
arm yourselves also with the same attitude (for whoever suffers in the flesh has
broken with sin), 
2
so as not to spend what remains of one's life
in the flesh on human desires, but on the will of God. 
3
For the time that has passed is sufficient for
doing what the Gentiles like to do: living in debauchery, evil desires,
drunkenness, orgies, carousing, and wanton idolatry. 
4
They are surprised that you do not plunge into
the same swamp of profligacy, and they vilify you; 
5
but they will give an account to him who stands
ready to judge the living and the dead. 
6
For this is why the gospel was preached even to
the dead 
[2]
 that, though condemned in the flesh in human
estimation, they might live in the spirit in the estimation of God. 
7
[3]
 The end of all things is at hand. Therefore,
be serious and sober for prayers. 
8
Above all, let your love for one another be
intense, because love covers a multitude of sins. 
[4]
9
Be hospitable to one another without
complaining. 
10
As each one has received a gift, use it to
serve one another as good stewards of God's varied grace. 
11
Whoever preaches, let it be with the words of
God; whoever serves, let it be with the strength that God supplies, so that in
all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong glory and
dominion forever and ever. Amen.
[5]
12
[6]
 Beloved, do not be surprised that a trial by
fire is occurring among you, as if something strange were happening to you. 
13
But rejoice to the extent that you share in the
sufferings of Christ, so that when his glory is revealed you may also rejoice
exultantly. 
14
If you are insulted for the name of Christ,
blessed are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. 
15
But let no one among you be made to suffer as a
murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as an intriguer. 
16
But whoever is made to suffer as a Christian
should not be ashamed but glorify God because of the name. 
17
For it is time for the judgment to begin with
the household of God; if it begins with us, how will it end for those who fail to
obey the gospel of God? 
18
"And if the righteous one is barely saved,
where will the godless and the sinner appear?" 
19
As a result, those who suffer in accord with
God's will hand their souls over to a faithful creator as they do good. 
1
 [1-6] Willingness to suffer with
Christ equips the Christian with the power to conquer sin (1). Christ is here
portrayed as the judge to whom those guilty of pagan vices must render an
account (
⇒
 1 Peter 4:5; cf 
⇒
 John
5:22-27; 
⇒
 Acts 10:42;
⇒
 2 Tim 4:1). 
2
 [6] The dead: these may be the
sinners of the flood generation who are possibly referred to in
⇒
 1 Peter 3:19. But many scholars think that there
is no connection between these two verses, and that the dead here are
Christians who have died since hearing the preaching of the gospel.
3
 [7-11] The inner life of the
eschatological community is outlined as the end (the parousia of Christ) and
the judgment draws near in terms of seriousness, sobriety, prayer, and love
expressed through hospitality and the use of one's gifts for the glory of God
and of Christ.
4
 [8] Love covers a multitude of
sins: a maxim based on 
⇒
 Proverb 10:12; see also
⇒
 Psalm 32:1; 
⇒
 James
5:20.
5
 [11] Some scholars feel that this
doxology concludes the part of the homily addressed specifically to the newly
baptized, begun in 
⇒
 1 Peter 1:3; others that it
concludes a baptismal liturgy. Such doxologies do occur within a New Testament
letter, e.g., 
⇒
 Romans 9:5. Some propose that
⇒
 1 Peter 4:11 was an alternate ending, with
⇒
 1 Peter 4:12-
⇒
 5:14
being read in places where persecution was more pressing. But such doxologies
usually do not occur at the end of letters (the only examples are
⇒
 2 Peter 3:18, 
⇒
 Jude
1:25, and 
⇒
 Romans 16:27, the last
probably a liturgical insertion).

 [12-19] The suffering to which the
author has already frequently referred is presented in more severe terms. This
has led some scholars to see these verses as referring to an actual
persecution. Others see the heightening of the language as only a rhetorical
device used at the end of the letter to emphasize the suffering motif.
