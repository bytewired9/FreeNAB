[1]
 So I exhort the presbyters 
[2]
among you, as a fellow presbyter and witness to the sufferings of Christ and
one who has a share in the glory to be revealed. 
2
Tend the flock of God in your midst,
(overseeing) not by constraint but willingly, as God would have it, not for
shameful profit but eagerly. 
3
Do not lord it over those assigned to you, but
be examples to the flock. 
4
And when the chief Shepherd is revealed, you
will receive the unfading crown of glory. 
[3]
5
[4]
 Likewise, you younger members, 
[5]
be subject to the presbyters. And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility
in your dealings with one another, for: "God opposes the proud but bestows
favor on the humble." 
6
So humble yourselves under the mighty hand of
God, that he may exalt you in due time. 
7
Cast all your worries upon him because he cares
for you. 
8
Be sober and vigilant. Your opponent the devil
is prowling around like a roaring lion looking for (someone) to devour. 
9
Resist him, steadfast in faith, knowing that
your fellow believers throughout the world undergo the same sufferings. 
10
The God of all grace who called you to his
eternal glory through Christ (Jesus) will himself restore, confirm, strengthen,
and establish you after you have suffered a little. 
11
To him be dominion forever. Amen. 
12
I write you this briefly through Silvanus, 
[6]
whom I consider a faithful brother, exhorting you and testifying that this is
the true grace of God. Remain firm in it. 
13
The chosen one 
[7]
 at Babylon
sends you greeting, as does Mark, my son. 
14
Greet one another with a loving kiss. Peace to
all of you who are in Christ. 
1
 [1-4] In imitation of Christ, the
chief shepherd, those entrusted with a pastoral office are to tend the flock by
their care and example.
2
 [1] Presbyters: the officially appointed
leaders and teachers of the Christian community (cf 
⇒
 1 Tim
5:17-18; 
⇒
 Titus 1:5-8;
⇒
 James 5:14). 
3
 [4] See the note on
⇒
 1 Peter 2:25.
4
 [5-11] The community is to be
subject to the presbyters and to show humility toward one another and trust in
God's love and care (
⇒
 1 Peter 5:5-7). With
sobriety, alertness, and steadfast faith they must resist the evil one; their
sufferings are shared with Christians everywhere (
⇒
5:8-9). They will be strengthened and called to eternal glory
(
⇒
 1 Peter 5:10-11).
5
 [5] Younger members: this may be a
designation for office-holders of lesser rank.
6
 [12] Silvanus: the companion of
Paul (see 
⇒
 2 Cor 1:19; 
⇒
 1 Thes
1:1; 
⇒
 2 Thes 1:1). Jews and Jewish Christians,
like Paul, often had a Hebrew name (Saoul, Silas) and a Greek or Latin name
(Paul, Silvanus). On Silvanus's possible role as amanuensis, see Introduction.
7
 [13] The chosen one: feminine,
referring to the Christian community (ekklesia) at Babylon, the code name for
Rome in 
⇒
 Rev 14:8;
⇒
 17:5; 
⇒
 18:2. Mark, my
son: traditionally a prominent disciple of Peter and co-worker at the church in
Rome, perhaps the John Mark referred to in 
⇒
 Acts
12:12, 
⇒
 25;
⇒
 13:5, 
⇒
 13; and in
⇒
 Acts 15:37-39, a companion of Barnabas. Perhaps this
is the same Mark mentioned as Barnabas's cousin in 
⇒
 Col
4:10, a co-worker with Paul in 
⇒
 Philippians
1:24 (see also 
⇒
 2 Tim 4:11).
