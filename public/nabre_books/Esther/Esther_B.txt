This is a copy of the letter: 
"The great King Ahasuerus writes to the satraps of the hundred and
twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia, and the governors subordinate to
them, as follows:
2
When I came to rule many peoples and to hold
sway over the whole world, I determined not to be carried away with the sense
of power, but always to deal fairly and with clemency; to provide for my
subjects a life of complete tranquillity; and by making my government humane
and effective as far as the borders, to restore the peace desired by all men. 
3
When I consulted my counselors as to how this
might be accomplished, Haman, who excels among us in wisdom, who is outstanding
for constant devotion and steadfast loyalty, and who has gained the second rank
in the kingdom, 
4
brought it to our attention that, mixed in with
all the races throughout the world, there is one people of bad will, which by
its laws is opposed to every other people and continually disregards the
decrees of kings, so that the unity of empire blamelessly designed by us cannot
be established. 
5
"Having noted, therefore, that this most
singular people is continually at variance with all men, lives by divergent and
alien laws, is inimical to our interests, and commits the worst crimes, so that
stability of government cannot be obtained, 
6
[1]
 we hereby decree that all those who are
indicated to you in the letters of Haman, who is in charge of the
administration and is a second father to us, shall, together with their wives
and children, be utterly destroyed by the swords of their enemies, without any
pity or mercy, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month, Adar, of the current
year; 
7
so that when these people, whose present ill
will is of long standing, have gone down into the nether world by a violent
death on a single day, they may at last leave our affairs stable and
undisturbed for the future." 
(Esther 3: 14-15)
3:14
A copy of the decree to be promulgated as law
in every province was published to all the peoples, that they might be prepared
for that day. 
3:15
The couriers set out in haste at the king's
command; meanwhile, the decree was promulgated in the stronghold of Susa. The
king and Haman then sat down to feast, but the city of Susa was thrown into
confusion.

 [6] Fourteenth day: the Hebrew
text, as in 
⇒
 Esther 2:13 above, and the Greek text
here translated do not agree on the day of the month specified by the king; in
fact, a two-day celebration is decreed in chapter 9, and the 13th, 14th and
15th of Adar are all mentioned; see
