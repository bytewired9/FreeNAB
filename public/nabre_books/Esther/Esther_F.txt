Then Mordecai said: "This is the work of
God.

I recall the dream I had about these very
things, and not a single detail has been left unfulfilled- 
3
the tiny spring that grew into a river, the
light of the sun, the many waters. The river is Esther, whom the king married
and made queen.

The nations are those who assembled to destroy
the name of the Jews, 
6
but my people is Israel, who cried to God and

 [7] Two lots: in this passage of
the Greek text, which gives a more religious interpretation of the feast, the
two lots are drawn by God to determine, respectively, the destiny of Israel and

 Esther 3:7 above, translated
from the Hebrew text, the feast is called Purim because of the lots which Aman
Cast to determine the day for the extinction of the Jews.

 [10] The Greek text of Esther
contains a postscript as follows: In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemy
and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said he was a priest and Levite, and his son
Ptolemy brought the present letter of Purim, saying that it was genuine and
that Lysimachus, son of Ptolemy, of the community of Jerusalem, had translated
it. The date referred to in this postscript is most probably 78-77 B.C., in the
reign of Ptolemy XII and Cleopatra V.
