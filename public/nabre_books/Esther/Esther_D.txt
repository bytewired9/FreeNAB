On the third day, putting an end to her
prayers, she took off her penitential garments and arrayed herself in her royal
attire. 
2
In making her state appearance, after invoking
the all-seeing God and savior, she took with her two maids; 
3
on the one she leaned gently for support, 
4
while the other followed her, bearing her
train. 
5
She glowed with the perfection of her beauty
and her countenance was as joyous as it was lovely, though her heart was shrunk
with fear. 
6
She passed through all the portals till she
stood face to face with the king, who was seated on his royal throne, clothed
in full robes of state, and covered with gold and precious stones, so that he
inspired great awe. 
7
As he looked up, his features ablaze with the
height of majestic anger, the queen staggered, changed color, and leaned weakly
against the head of the maid in front of her. 
8
But God changed the king's anger to gentleness.
In great anxiety he sprang from his throne, held her in his arms until she
recovered, and comforted her with reassuring words. 
9
"What is it, Esther?" he said to her.
"I am your brother. Take courage! 
10
You shall not die because of this general
decree of ours. 
11
Come near!" 
12
Raising the golden scepter, he touched her neck
with it, embraced her, and said, "Speak to me." 
13
She replied: "I saw you, my lord, as an
angel of God, and my heart was troubled with fear of your majesty. 
14
For you are awesome, my lord, though your
glance is full of kindness." 
15
As she said this, she fainted. 
16
The king became troubled and all his attendants
tried to revive her.
