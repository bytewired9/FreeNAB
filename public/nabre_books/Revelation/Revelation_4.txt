[1]
 After this I had a vision of an open door 
[2]
to heaven, and I heard the trumpetlike voice that had spoken to me before,
saying, "Come up here and I will show you what must happen
afterwards." 
2
[3]
 At once I was caught up in spirit. A throne
was there in heaven, and on the throne sat 
3
one whose appearance sparkled like jasper and
carnelian. Around the throne was a halo as brilliant as an emerald. 
4
Surrounding the throne I saw twenty-four other
thrones on which twenty-four elders 
[4]
 sat, dressed in white
garments and with gold crowns on their heads. 
5
From the throne came flashes of lightning,
rumblings, and peals of thunder. 
[5]
 Seven flaming torches
burned in front of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God. 
6
In front of the throne was something that
resembled a sea of glass like crystal. 
[6]
 In the center and
around the throne, there were four living creatures covered with eyes in front
and in back. 
7
The first creature resembled a lion, the second
was like a calf, the third had a face like that of a human being, and the
fourth looked like an eagle 
[7]
 in flight. 
8
The four living creatures, each of them with
six wings, 
[8]
 were covered with eyes inside and out. Day and
night they do not stop exclaiming: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God
almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come." 
9
Whenever the living creatures give glory and
honor and thanks to the one who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,
10
the twenty-four elders fall down before the one
who sits on the throne and worship him, who lives forever and ever. They throw
down their crowns before the throne, exclaiming: 
11
"Worthy are you, Lord our God, to receive
glory and honor and power, for you created all things; because of your will
they came to be and were created."

 [1-11] The seer now describes a
vision of the heavenly court in worship of God enthroned. He reverently avoids
naming or describing God but pictures twenty-four elders in priestly and regal
attire (
⇒
 Rev 4:4) and God's throne and its
surroundings made of precious gems and other symbols that traditionally express
the majesty of God (
⇒
 Rev 4:5-6). Universal creation
is represented by the four living creatures (
⇒
 Rev
4:6-7). Along with the twenty-four elders, they praise God
unceasingly in humble adoration (
⇒
 Rev 4:8-11).
2
 [1] The ancients viewed heaven as a
solid vault, entered by way of actual doors. 
3
 [2-8] Much of the imagery here is
taken from 
⇒
 Ezekiel 1:10.
4
 [4] Twenty-four elders: these
represent the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles; cf
⇒
 Rev 21:12-14.
5
 [5] Flashes of lightning,
rumblings, and peals of thunder: as in other descriptions of God's appearance
or activity; cf 
⇒
 Rev 8:5;
⇒
 11:19; 
⇒
 16:18;
⇒
 Exodus 19:16; 
⇒
 Ezekiel
1:4, 
⇒
 13. The seven spirits of God: the
seven "angels of the presence" as in 
⇒
 Rev
8:2 and 
⇒
 Tobit 12:15.
6
 [6] A sea of glass like crystal: an
image adapted from 
⇒
 Ezekiel 1:22-26. Four living
creatures: these are symbols taken from 
⇒
 Ezekiel
1:5-21; they are identified as cherubim in
⇒
 Ezekiel 10:20. Covered with eyes: these suggest
God's knowledge and concern.
7
 [7] Lion . . . calf . . . human
being . . . eagle: these symbolize, respectively, what is noblest, strongest,
wisest, and swiftest in creation. Calf: traditionally translated
"ox," the Greek word refers to a heifer or young bull. Since the second
century, these four creatures have been used as symbols of the evangelists
Mark, Luke, Matthew, and John, respectively.

 [8] Six wings: like the seraphim of
⇒
 Isaiah 6:2.
