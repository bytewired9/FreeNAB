[1]
 I saw a scroll 
[2]
 in the
right hand of the one who sat on the throne. It had writing on both sides and
was sealed with seven seals. 
2
Then I saw a mighty angel who proclaimed in a
loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?" 
3
But no one in heaven or on earth or under the
earth was able to open the scroll or to examine it. 
4
I shed many tears because no one was found
worthy to open the scroll or to examine it. 
5
One of the elders said to me, "Do not
weep. The lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, 
[3]
has triumphed, enabling him to open the scroll with its seven seals." 
6
Then I saw standing in the midst of the throne
and the four living creatures and the elders, a Lamb 
[4]
 that
seemed to have been slain. He had seven horns and seven eyes; these are the
(seven) spirits of God sent out into the whole world. 
7
He came and received the scroll from the right
hand of the one who sat on the throne. 
8
When he took it, the four living creatures and
the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each of the elders held a harp
and gold bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of the holy ones. 
9
They sang a new hymn: "Worthy are you to
receive the scroll and to break open its seals, for you were slain and with
your blood you purchased for God those from every tribe and tongue, people and
nation. 
10
You made them a kingdom and priests for our
God, and they will reign on earth." 
11
I looked again and heard the voices of many
angels who surrounded the throne and the living creatures and the elders. They
were countless 
[5]
 in number, 
12
and they cried out in a loud voice:
"Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches, wisdom and
strength, honor and glory and blessing." 
13
Then I heard every creature in heaven and on
earth and under the earth and in the sea, everything in the universe, cry out:
"To the one who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor,
glory and might, forever and ever." 
14
The four living creatures answered,
"Amen," and the elders fell down and worshiped.

 [1-14] The seer now describes a
papyrus roll in God's right hand (
⇒
 Rev 5:1) with
seven seals indicating the importance of the message. A mighty angel asks who
is worthy to open the scroll, i.e., who can accomplish God's salvific plan
(<
⇒
 Rev 5:2). There is despair at first when no
one in creation can do it (
⇒
 Rev 5:3-4). But the seer
is comforted by an elder who tells him that Christ, called the lion of the
tribe of Judah, has won the right to open it (
⇒
 Rev
5:5). Christ then appears as a Lamb, coming to receive the scroll
from God (
⇒
 Rev 5:6-7), for which he is acclaimed as
at a coronation (
⇒
 Rev 5:8-10). This is followed by a
doxology of the angels (
⇒
 Rev 5:11-12) and then
finally by the heavenly church united with all of creation
(
⇒
 Rev 5:13-14).

 [1] A scroll: a papyrus roll
possibly containing a list of afflictions for sinners (cf
⇒
 Ezekiel 2:9-10) or God's plan for the world. Sealed
with seven seals: it is totally hidden from all but God. Only the Lamb
(
⇒
 Rev 5:7-9) has the right to carry out the divine
plan.

symbolize his victory; cf

 Acts
8:32;

 1 Peter 1:18-19. This is the main
title for Christ in Rev, used twenty-eight times. Seven horns and seven eyes:
Christ has the fullness (see the note on 
⇒
 Rev 1:4)
of power (horns) and knowledge (eyes); cf

 Zechariah
4:7. [Seven] spirits: as in
