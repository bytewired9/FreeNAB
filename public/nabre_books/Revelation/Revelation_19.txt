After this I heard what sounded like the loud
voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying: "Alleluia! 
[1]
Salvation, glory, and might belong to our God, 
2
for true and just are his judgments. He has
condemned the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her harlotry. He has
avenged on her the blood of his servants." 
3
They said a second time: "Alleluia! Smoke
will rise from her forever and ever." 
4
The twenty-four elders and the four living
creatures fell down and worshiped God who sat on the throne, saying,
"Amen. Alleluia." 
5
[2]
 A voice coming from the throne said:
"Praise our God, all you his servants, (and) you who revere him, small and
great." 
6
Then I heard something like the sound of a
great multitude or the sound of rushing water or mighty peals of thunder, as
they said: "Alleluia! The Lord has established his reign, (our) God, the
almighty. 
7
Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory.
For the wedding day of the Lamb 
[3]
 has come, his bride has
made herself ready. 
8
She was allowed to wear a bright, clean linen
garment." (The linen represents the righteous deeds of the holy ones.) 
[4]
9
Then the angel said to me, "Write this:
Blessed 
[5]
 are those who have been called to the wedding
feast of the Lamb." And he said to me, "These words are true; they
come from God." 
10
I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said
to me, "Don't! I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brothers who
bear witness to Jesus. Worship God. Witness to Jesus is the spirit of
prophecy." 
[6]
11
[7]
 Then I saw the heavens opened, and there was a
white horse; its rider was (called) "Faithful and True." He judges
and wages war in righteousness. 
12
His eyes were (like) a fiery flame, and on his
head were many diadems. He had a name 
[8]
 inscribed that no
one knows except himself. 
13
He wore a cloak that had been dipped in 
[9]
blood, and his name was called the Word of God. 
14
The armies of heaven followed him, mounted on
white horses and wearing clean white linen. 
15
Out of his mouth came a sharp sword to strike
the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod, and he himself will tread out
in the wine press 
[10]
 the wine of the fury and wrath of God
the almighty. 
16
He has a name written on his cloak and on his
thigh, "King of kings and Lord of lords." 
17
[11]
 Then I saw an angel standing on the sun. He
cried out (in) a loud voice to all the birds flying high overhead, "Come
here. Gather for God's great feast, 
18
to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of military
officers, and the flesh of warriors, the flesh of horses and of their riders,
and the flesh of all, free and slave, small and great." 
19
Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth
and their armies gathered to fight against the one riding the horse and against
his army. 
20
The beast was caught and with it the false
prophet 
[12]
 who had performed in its sight the signs by which
he led astray those who had accepted the mark of the beast and those who had
worshiped its image. The two were thrown alive into the fiery pool burning with
sulfur. 
21
The rest were killed by the sword that came out
of the mouth of the one riding the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves
on their flesh.

 [1,3,4,6] Alleluia: found only here
in the New Testament, this frequent exclamation of praise in the Hebrew psalms
was important in Jewish liturgy. 
2
 [5-10] A victory song follows, sung
by the entire church, celebrating the marriage of the Lamb, the union of the
Messiah with the community of the elect.
