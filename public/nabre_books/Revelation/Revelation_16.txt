[1]
 I heard a loud voice speaking from the temple
to the seven angels, "Go and pour out the seven bowls of God's fury upon
the earth." 
2
The first angel went and poured out his bowl on
the earth. Festering and ugly sores broke out on those who had the mark of the
beast or worshiped its image. 
[2]
3
[3]
 The second angel poured out his bowl on the
sea. The sea turned to blood like that from a corpse; every creature living in
the sea died. 
4
The third angel poured out his bowl on the
rivers and springs of water. These also turned to blood. 
5
Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters
say: "You are just, O Holy One, who are and who were, in passing this
sentence. 
6
For they have shed the blood of the holy ones
and the prophets, and you (have) given them blood to drink; it is what they
deserve." 
7
Then I heard the altar cry out, "Yes, Lord
God almighty, your judgments are true and just." 
8
The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the
sun. It was given the power to burn people with fire. 
9
People were burned by the scorching heat and
blasphemed the name of God who had power over these plagues, but they did not
repent or give him glory. 
10
The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the
throne of the beast. 
[4]
 Its kingdom was plunged into
darkness, and people bit their tongues in pain 
11
and blasphemed the God of heaven because of
their pains and sores. But they did not repent of their works. 
12
The sixth angel emptied his bowl on the great
river Euphrates. Its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings of the
East. 
[5]
13
I saw three unclean spirits like frogs 
[6]
come from the mouth of the dragon, from the mouth of the beast, and from the
mouth of the false prophet. 
14
These were demonic spirits who performed signs.
They went out to the kings of the whole world to assemble them for the battle
on the great day of God the almighty. 
15
("Behold, I am coming like a thief." 
[7]
Blessed is the one who watches and keeps his clothes ready, so that he may not
go naked and people see him exposed.) 
16
They then assembled the kings in the place that
is named Armageddon 
[8]
 in Hebrew. 
17
The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the
air. A loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, "It is
done." 
18
Then there were lightning flashes, rumblings,
and peals of thunder, and a great earthquake. It was such a violent earthquake
that there has never been one like it since the human race began on earth. 
19
The great city 
[9]
 was split
into three parts, and the gentile cities fell. But God remembered great
Babylon, giving it the cup filled with the wine of his fury and wrath. 
20
[10]
 Every island fled, and mountains disappeared. 
21
Large hailstones like huge weights came down
from the sky on people, and they blasphemed God for the plague of hail because
this plague was so severe. 
1
 [1-21] These seven bowls, like the
seven seals (
⇒
 Rev 6:1-17;
⇒
 8:1) and the seven trumpets (
⇒
 Rev
8:2-
⇒
 9:21;
⇒
 11:15-19), bring on a succession of disasters
modeled in part on the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-12). See the note on
⇒
 Rev 6:12-14. 
2
 [2] Like the sixth Egyptian plague
(
⇒
 Exodus 9:8-11).
3
 [3-4] Like the first Egyptian
plague (
⇒
 Exodus 7:20-21). The same woe followed the
blowing of the second trumpet (
⇒
 Rev 8:8-9).
4
 [10] The throne of the beast:
symbol of the forces of evil. Darkness: like the ninth Egyptian plague
(
⇒
 Exodus 10:21-23); cf 
⇒
 Rev
9:2.
5
 [12] The kings of the East:
Parthians; see the notes on 
⇒
 Rev 6:2 and
⇒
 Rev 17:12-13. East: literally, "rising of
the sun," as in <
⇒
 Rev 7:2.
6
 [13] Frogs: possibly an allusion to
the second Egyptian plague (
⇒
 Exodus
7:25-
⇒
 8:11). The false prophet:
identified with the two-horned second beast (
⇒
 Rev
13:11-18 and the note there).
7
 [15] Like a thief: as in
⇒
 Rev 3:3 (cf 
⇒
 Matthew
24:42-44; 
⇒
 1 Thes 5:2). Blessed: see the
note on 
⇒
 Rev 1:3.
8
 [16] Armageddon: in Hebrew, this
means "Mountain of Megiddo." Since Megiddo was the scene of many
decisive battles in antiquity (
⇒
 Judges 5:19-20;
⇒
 2 Kings 9:27; 
⇒
 2 Chron
35:20-24), the town became the symbol of the final disastrous rout of
the forces of evil.
9
 [19] The great city: Rome and the
empire.
10
 [20-21] See the note on
⇒
 Rev 6:12-14. Hailstones: as in the seventh
Egyptian plague (
⇒
 Exodus 9:23-24); cf
⇒
 Rev 8:7. Like huge weights: literally,
"weighing a talent," about one hundred pounds.
