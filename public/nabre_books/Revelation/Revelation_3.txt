 "To the angel of the church in Sardis, 
[2]
write this: " 'The one who has the seven spirits of God and the seven
stars says this: "I know your works, that you have the reputation of being
alive, but you are dead. 
2
Be watchful and strengthen what is left, which
is going to die, for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my
God. 
3
Remember then how you accepted and heard; keep
it, and repent. If you are not watchful, I will come like a thief, and you will
never know at what hour I will come upon you. 
4
However, you have a few people in Sardis who
have not soiled their garments; they will walk with me dressed in white,
because they are worthy. 
5
" '"The victor will thus be dressed
in white, 
[3]
 and I will never erase his name from the book of
life but will acknowledge his name in the presence of my Father and of his
angels. 
6
" '"Whoever has ears ought to hear
what the Spirit says to the churches."' 
7
[4]
 "To the angel of the church in Philadelphia,
[5]
 write this: " 'The holy one, the true, who holds the
key of David, who opens and no one shall close, who closes and no one shall
open, says this: 
8
" '"I know your works (behold, I have
left an open door 
[6]
 before you, which no one can close). You
have limited strength, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my
name. 
9
Behold, I will make those of the assembly of
Satan who claim to be Jews and are not, but are lying, behold I will make them
come and fall prostrate at your feet, and they will realize that I love you. 
10
Because you have kept my message of endurance, 
[7]
I will keep you safe in the time of trial that is going to come to the whole
world to test the inhabitants of the earth. 
11
I am coming quickly. Hold fast to what you
have, so that no one may take your crown. 
12
" '"The victor I will make into a
pillar 
[8]
 in the temple of my God, and he will never leave it
again. On him I will inscribe the name of my God and the name of the city of my
God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God, as well as
my new name. 
13
" '"Whoever has ears ought to hear
what the Spirit says to the churches."' 
14
[9]
 "To the angel of the church in Laodicea, 
[10]
write this: " 'The Amen, the faithful and true witness, the source of
God's creation, says this: 
15
"I know your works; I know that you are
neither cold nor hot. 
[11]
 I wish you were either cold or hot.
16
[12]
 So, because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor
cold, I will spit you out of my mouth. 
17
[13]
 For you say, 'I am rich and affluent and have
no need of anything,' and yet do not realize that you are wretched, pitiable,
poor, blind, and naked. 
18
I advise you to buy from me gold refined by
fire 
[14]
 so that you may be rich, and white garments to put
on so that your shameful nakedness may not be exposed, and buy ointment to
smear on your eyes so that you may see. 
19
Those whom I love, I reprove and chastise. Be
earnest, therefore, and repent. 
20
" '"Behold, I stand at the door and
knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, (then) I will enter his
house and dine with him, and he with me. 
[15]
21
I will give the victor the right to sit with me
on my throne, as I myself first won the victory and sit with my Father on his
throne. 
22
" '"Whoever has ears ought to hear
what the Spirit says to the churches."'"

 [1-6] The letter to Sardis does not
praise the community but admonishes its members to watchfulness, mutual
support, and repentance (
⇒
 Rev 3:2-3). The few who
have remained pure and faithful will share Christ's victory and will be
inscribed in the book of life (
⇒
 Rev 3:4-5).
2
 [1] Sardis: this city, located ca.
thirty miles southeast of Thyatira, was once the capital of Lydia, known for
its wealth at the time of Croesus (6th century B.C.). Its citadel, reputed to
be unassailable, was captured by surprise, first by Cyrus and later by Antiochus.
The church is therefore warned to be on guard. 
3
 [5] In white: white is a sign of
victory and joy as well as resurrection; see the note on 
⇒
 Rev
2:17. The book of life: the roll in which the names of the redeemed
are kept; cf 
⇒
 Rev 13:8;
⇒
 17:8; 
⇒
 20:12,
⇒
 15; 
⇒
 21:27;
⇒
 Philippians 4:3; 
⇒
 Daniel
12:1. They will be acknowledged by Christ in heaven; cf
⇒
 Matthew 10:32.
4
 [7-13] The letter to Philadelphia
praises the Christians there for remaining faithful even with their limited
strength (
⇒
 Rev 3:8). Members of the assembly of
Satan are again singled out (
⇒
 Rev 3:9; see
⇒
 Rev 2:9). There is no admonition; rather, the
letter promises that they will be kept safe at the great trial
(
⇒
 Rev 3:10-11) and that the victors will become
pillars of the heavenly temple, upon which three names will be inscribed: God,
Jerusalem, and Christ (
⇒
 Rev 3:12).
5
 [7] Philadelphia: modern Alasehir,
ca. thirty miles southeast of Sardis, founded by Attalus II Philadelphus of
Pergamum to be an "open door" (
⇒
 Rev 3:8)
for Greek culture; it was destroyed by an earthquake in A.D. 17. Rebuilt by
money from the Emperor Tiberius, the city was renamed Neo-Caesarea; this may
explain the allusions to "name" in 
⇒
 Rev
3:12. Key of David: to the heavenly city of David (cf
⇒
 Isaiah 22:22), "the new Jerusalem"
(
⇒
 Rev 3:12), over which Christ has supreme
authority.
6
 [8] An open door: opportunities for
sharing and proclaiming the faith; cf 
⇒
 Acts 14:27;
⇒
 1 Cor 16:9; 
⇒
 2 Cor
2:12.
7
 [10] My message of endurance: this
does not refer to a saying of Jesus about patience but to the example of
Christ's patient endurance. The inhabitants of the earth: literally,
"those who live on the earth." This expression, which also occurs in
⇒
 Rev 6:10; 
⇒
 8:13;
⇒
 11:10; 
⇒
 13:8,
⇒
 12, 
⇒
 14; 
⇒
 17:2,
8, always refers to the pagan world.
8
 [12] Pillar: this may be an
allusion to the rebuilding of the city; see the note on v 7. New Jerusalem: it
is described in 
⇒
 Rev 21:10-
⇒
 22:5.
9
 [14-22] The letter to Laodicea
reprimands the community for being lukewarm (
⇒
 Rev
3:15-16), but no particular faults are singled out. Their material
prosperity is contrasted with their spiritual poverty, the violet tunics that
were the source of their wealth with the white robe of baptism, and their
famous eye ointment with true spiritual perception (
⇒
 Rev
3:17-18). But Christ's chastisement is inspired by love and a desire
to be allowed to share the messianic banquet with his followers in the heavenly
kingdom (
⇒
 Rev 3:9-21).
10
 [14] Laodicea: ca. forty miles
southeast of Philadelphia and ca. eighty miles east of Ephesus, a wealthy
industrial and commercial center, with a renowned medical school. It exported
fine woolen garments and was famous for its eye salves. It was so wealthy that
it was proudly rebuilt without outside aid after the devastating earthquake of
A.D. 60/61. The Amen: this is a divine title (cf Hebrew text of
⇒
 Isaiah 65:16) applied to Christ; cf
⇒
 2 Cor 1:20. Source of God's creation: literally,
"the beginning of God's creation," a concept found also in
⇒
 John 1:3; 
⇒
 Col 1:16-17,
⇒
 Hebrews 1:2; cf 
⇒
 Proverb
8:22-31; 
⇒
 Wisdom 9:1-2.
11
 [15-16] Halfhearted commitment to
the faith is nauseating to Christ; cf 
⇒
 Romans
12:11.
12
 [16] Spit: literally,
"vomit." The image is that of a beverage that should be either hot or
cold. Perhaps there is an allusion to the hot springs of Hierapolis across the
Lycus river from Laodicea, which would have been lukewarm by the time they
reached Laodicea.
13
 [17] Economic prosperity occasioned
spiritual bankruptcy.
14
 [18] Gold . . . fire: God's grace.
White garments: symbol of an upright life; the city was noted for its
violet/purple cloth. Ointment . . . eyes: to remove spiritual blindness; one of
the city's exports was eye ointment (see the note on 
⇒
 Rev
3:14).
15
 [20] Christ invites all to the
messianic banquet in heaven; cf 
⇒
 Isaiah 25:6;
⇒
 Luke 14:15; 
⇒
 22:30.
