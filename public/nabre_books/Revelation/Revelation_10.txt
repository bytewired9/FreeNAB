 Then I saw another mighty
angel come down from heaven wrapped in a cloud, with a halo around his head;
his face was like the sun and his feet were like pillars of fire. 
2
In his hand he held a small scroll that had
been opened. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,
[3]
3
and then he cried out in a loud voice as a lion
roars. When he cried out, the seven thunders raised their voices, too. 
4
When the seven thunders had spoken, I was about
to write it down; but I heard a voice from heaven say, "Seal up what the
seven thunders have spoken, but do not write it down." 
5
Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on
the land raised his right hand to heaven 
6
and swore by the one who lives forever and
ever, who created heaven and earth and sea 
[4]
 and all that is
in them, "There shall be no more delay. 
7
At the time when you hear the seventh angel
blow his trumpet, the mysterious plan of God 
[5]
 shall be
fulfilled, as he promised to his servants the prophets." 
8
Then the voice that I had heard from heaven
spoke to me again and said, "Go, take the scroll that lies open in the
hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land." 
9
So I went up to the angel and told him to give
me the small scroll. He said to me, "Take and swallow it. It will turn
your stomach sour, but in your mouth it will taste as sweet 
[6]
as honey." 
10
I took the small scroll from the angel's hand
and swallowed it. In my mouth it was like sweet honey, but when I had eaten it,
my stomach turned sour. 
11
Then someone said to me, "You must
prophesy again about many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings."

 10:1-

 11:14] An
interlude in two scenes (
⇒
 Rev 10:1-11 and
⇒
 Rev 11:1-14) precedes the sounding of the seventh
trumpet; cf 
⇒
 Rev 7:1-17. The first vision describes
an angel astride sea and land like a colossus, with a small scroll open, the
contents of which indicate that the end is imminent (Rev 10). The second vision
is of the measuring of the temple and of two witnesses, whose martyrdom means
that the kingdom of God is about to be inaugurated.

 [1] The seven thunders: God's voice
announcing judgment and doom; cf 
⇒
 Psalm 29:3-9,
where thunder, as the voice of Yahweh, is praised seven times. 
3
 [2] He placed . . . on the land:
this symbolizes the universality of the angel's message, as does the figure of
the small scroll open to be read.

 [6] Heaven and earth and sea: the
three parts of the universe. No more delay: cf

 Daniel
12:7;

 Hebrews 2:3.

 [7] The mysterious plan of God:
literally, "the mystery of God," the end of the present age when the
forces of evil will be put down (

 Rev
17:1-

 19:4,

 11-21; 
⇒
 20:7-10; cf
⇒
 2 Thes 2:6-12; 
⇒
 Romans
16:25-26), and the establishment of the reign of God when all
creation will be made new (
⇒
 Rev
21:1-
⇒
 22:5).

 [9-10] The small scroll was sweet
because it predicted the final victory of God's people; it was sour because it
also announced their sufferings. Cf 
⇒
 Ezekiel 3:1-3.
