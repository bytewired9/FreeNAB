[1]
 Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff
and I was told, "Come and measure the temple of God and the altar, and count
those who are worshiping in it. 
2
But exclude the outer court 
[2]
of the temple; do not measure it, for it has been handed over to the Gentiles,
who will trample the holy city for forty-two months. 
3
I will commission my two witnesses 
[3]
to prophesy for those twelve hundred and sixty days, wearing sackcloth." 
4
These are the two olive trees and the two
lampstands 
[4]
 that stand before the Lord of the earth. 
5
[5]
 If anyone wants to harm them, fire comes out
of their mouths and devours their enemies. In this way, anyone wanting to harm
them is sure to be slain. 
6
They have the power to close up the sky so that
no rain can fall during the time of their prophesying. They also have power to
turn water into blood and to afflict the earth with any plague as often as they
wish. 
7
When they have finished their testimony, the
beast that comes up from the abyss 
[6]
 will wage war against
them and conquer them and kill them. 
8
Their corpses will lie in the main street of
the great city, 
[7]
 which has the symbolic names
"Sodom" and "Egypt," where indeed their Lord was crucified.
9
[8]
 Those from every people, tribe, tongue, and
nation will gaze on their corpses for three and a half days, and they will not
allow their corpses to be buried. 
10
The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over
them and be glad and exchange gifts because these two prophets tormented the
inhabitants of the earth. 
11
But after the three and a half days, a breath
of life from God entered them. When they stood on their feet, great fear fell
on those who saw them. 
12
Then they heard a loud voice from heaven say to
them, "Come up here." So they went up to heaven in a cloud as their
enemies looked on. 
13
At that moment there was a great earthquake,
and a tenth of the city fell in ruins. Seven thousand people 
[9]
were killed during the earthquake; the rest were terrified and gave glory to
the God of heaven. 
14
The second woe has passed, but the third is
coming soon. 
15
[10]
 Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet. There
were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdom of the world now belongs
to our Lord and to his Anointed, and he will reign forever and ever." 
16
The twenty-four elders who sat on their thrones
before God prostrated themselves and worshiped God 
17
and said: "We give thanks to you, Lord God
almighty, who are and who were. For you have assumed your great power and have
established your reign. 
18
The nations raged, but your wrath has come, and
the time for the dead to be judged, and to recompense your servants, the
prophets, and the holy ones and those who fear your name, the small and the
great alike, and to destroy those who destroy the earth." 
19
Then God's temple in heaven was opened, and the
ark of his covenant could be seen in the temple. There were flashes of
lightning, rumblings, and peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a violent
hailstorm. 
1
 [1] The temple and altar symbolize
the new Israel; see the note on 
⇒
 Rev 7:4-9. The
worshipers represent Christians. The measuring of the temple (cf
⇒
 Ezekiel 40:3-
⇒
 42:20;
⇒
 47:1-12; 
⇒
 Zechariah
2:5-6) suggests that God will preserve the faithful remnant (cf
⇒
 Isaiah 4:2-3) who remain true to Christ
(
⇒
 Rev 14:1-5). 
2
 [2] The outer court: the Court of
the Gentiles. Trample . . . forty-two months: the duration of the vicious
persecution of the Jews by Antiochus IV Epiphanes (
⇒
 Daniel
7:25; 
⇒
 12:7); this persecution of three
and a half years (half of seven, counted as 1260 days in 
⇒
 Rev
11:3; 
⇒
 12:6) became the prototype of
periods of trial for God's people; cf 
⇒
 Luke 4:25;
⇒
 James 5:17. The reference here is to the
persecution by the Romans; cf Introduction.
3
 [3] The two witnesses, wearing
sackcloth symbolizing lamentation and repentance, cannot readily be identified.
Do they represent Moses and Elijah, or the Law and the Prophets, or Peter and
Paul? Most probably they refer to the universal church, especially the
Christian martyrs, fulfilling the office of witness (two because of
⇒
 Deut 19:15; cf 
⇒
 Mark
6:7; 
⇒
 John 8:17).
4
 [4] The two olive trees and the two
lampstands: the martyrs who stand in the presence of the Lord; the imagery is
taken from 
⇒
 Zechariah 4:8-14, where the olive trees
refer to Zerubbabel and Joshua.
5
 [5-6] These details are derived
from stories of Moses, who turned water into blood (
⇒
 Exodus
7:17-20), and of Elijah, who called down fire from heaven
(
⇒
 1 Kings 18:36-40; 
⇒
 2 Kings
1:10) and closed up the sky for three years (
⇒
 1
Kings 17:1; cf 
⇒
 18:1).
6
 [7] The beast . . . from the abyss:
the Roman emperor Nero, who symbolizes the forces of evil, or the antichrist
(
⇒
 Rev 13:1, 8;
⇒
 17:8); cf 
⇒
 Daniel
7:2-8, 
⇒
 11-12,
⇒
 19-22 and Introduction.
7
 [8] The great city: this expression
is used constantly in Rev for Babylon, i.e., Rome; cf 
⇒
 Rev
14:8; 
⇒
 16:19;
⇒
 17:18; 
⇒
 18:2,
⇒
 10, 
⇒
 21.
"Sodom" and "Egypt": symbols of immorality (cf
⇒
 Isaiah 1:10) and oppression of God's people (cf
⇒
 Exodus 1:11-14). Where indeed their Lord was
crucified: not the geographical but the symbolic Jerusalem that rejects God and
his witnesses, i.e., Rome, called Babylon in Rev 16-18; see the note on
⇒
 Rev 17:9 and Introduction.
8
 [9-12] Over the martyrdom
(
⇒
 Rev 11:7) of the two witnesses, now called
prophets, the ungodly rejoice for three and a half days, a symbolic period of
time; see the note on 
⇒
 Rev 11:2. Afterwards they go
in triumph to heaven, as did Elijah (
⇒
 2 Kings
2:11).
9
 [13] Seven thousand people: a
symbolic sum to represent all social classes (seven) and large numbers
(thousands); cf Introduction.
10
 [15-19] The seventh trumpet
proclaims the coming of God's reign after the victory over diabolical powers;
see the note on

 Rev 10:7.
