[1]
 When he broke open the seventh seal, there was
silence in heaven 
[2]
 for about half an hour. 
2
And I saw that the seven angels who stood
before God were given seven trumpets. 
3
Another angel came and stood at the altar, 
[3]
holding a gold censer. He was given a great quantity of incense to offer, along
with the prayers of all the holy ones, on the gold altar that was before the
throne. 
4
The smoke of the incense along with the prayers
of the holy ones went up before God from the hand of the angel. 
5
Then the angel took the censer, filled it with
burning coals from the altar, and hurled it down to the earth. There were peals
of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake. 
6
The seven angels who were holding the seven
trumpets prepared to blow them. 
7
When the first one blew his trumpet, there came
hail and fire mixed with blood, which was hurled down to the earth. A third of
the land was burned up, along with a third of the trees and all green grass. 
[4]
8
[5]
 When the second angel blew his trumpet,
something like a large burning mountain was hurled into the sea. A third of the
sea turned to blood, 
9
a third of the creatures living in the sea 
[6]
died, and a third of the ships were wrecked. 
10
When the third angel blew his trumpet, a large
star burning like a torch fell from the sky. It fell on a third of the rivers and
on the springs of water. 
11
The star was called "Wormwood," 
[7]
and a third of all the water turned to wormwood. Many people died from this
water, because it was made bitter. 
12
When the fourth angel blew his trumpet, a third
of the sun, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars were struck, so that
a third of them became dark. The day lost its light for a third of the time, as
did the night. 
13
Then I looked again and heard an eagle flying
high overhead cry out in a loud voice, "Woe! Woe! Woe 
[8]
to the inhabitants of the earth from the rest of the trumpet blasts that the
three angels are about to blow!" 
1
 [1-13] The breaking of the seventh
seal produces at first silence and then seven symbolic disasters, each
announced by a trumpet blast, of which the first four form a unit as did the
first four seals. A minor liturgy (
⇒
 Rev 8:3-5) is
enclosed by a vision of seven angels (
⇒
 Rev 8:2,
6). Then follow the first four trumpet blasts, each
heralding catastrophes modeled on the plagues of Egypt affecting the
traditional prophetic third (cf 
⇒
 Ezekiel 5:12) of
the earth, sea, fresh water, and stars (
⇒
 Rev 8:7-12).
Finally, there is a vision of an eagle warning of the last three trumpet blasts
(
⇒
 Rev 8:13).
2
 [1] Silence in heaven: as in
⇒
 Zephaniah 1:7, a prelude to the eschatological woes
that are to follow; cf Introduction. 
3
 [3] Altar: there seems to be only
one altar in the heavenly temple, corresponding to the altar of holocausts in
⇒
 Rev 6:9, and here to the altar of incense in
Jerusalem; cf also 
⇒
 Rev 9:13;
⇒
 11:1; 
⇒
 14:18;
⇒
 16:7.
4
 [7] This woe resembles the seventh
plague of Egypt (
⇒
 Exodus 9:23-24); cf
Joel 2:30.
5
 [8-11] The background of these two
woes is the first plague of Egypt (
⇒
 Exodus
7:20-21).
6
 [9] Creatures living in the sea:
literally, "creatures in the sea that had souls."
7
 [11] Wormwood: an extremely bitter
and malignant plant symbolizing the punishment God inflicts on the ungodly; cf
⇒
 Jeremiah 9:12-14;
⇒
 23:15.
8
 [13] Woe! Woe! Woe: each of the three woes pronounced by
the angel represents a separate disaster; cf 
⇒
 Rev
9:12; 
⇒
 11:14. The final woe, released by
the seventh trumpet blast, includes the plagues of Rev 16.
