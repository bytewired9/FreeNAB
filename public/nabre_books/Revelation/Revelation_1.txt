[1]
 The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave
to him, to show his servants what must happen soon. He made it known by sending
his angel to his servant John, 
2
who gives witness to the word of God and to the
testimony of Jesus Christ by reporting what he saw. 
3
Blessed is the one 
[2]
 who
reads aloud and blessed are those who listen to this prophetic message and heed
what is written in it, for the appointed time is near. 
4
[3]
 John, to the seven churches in Asia: 
[4]
grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from
the seven spirits before his throne, 
5
and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness,
the firstborn of the dead and ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves
us and has freed us 
[5]
 from our sins by his blood, 
6
who has made us into a kingdom, priests for his
God and Father, to him be glory and power forever (and ever). Amen. 
7
Behold, he is coming amid the clouds, and every
eye will see him, even those who pierced him. All the peoples of the earth will
lament him. Yes. Amen. 
8
"I am the Alpha and the Omega," 
[6]
says the Lord God, "the one who is and who was and who is to come, the
almighty." 
9
[7]
 I, John, your brother, who share with you the
distress, the kingdom, and the endurance we have in Jesus, found myself on the
island called Patmos 
[8]
 because I proclaimed God's word and gave
testimony to Jesus. 
10
I was caught up in spirit on the Lord's day 
[9]
and heard behind me a voice as loud as a trumpet, 
11
which said, "Write on a scroll 
[10]
what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum,
Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea." 
12
[11]
 Then I turned to see whose voice it was that
spoke to me, and when I turned, I saw seven gold lampstands 
13
and in the midst of the lampstands one like a
son of man, 
[12]
 wearing an ankle-length robe, with a gold
sash around his chest. 
14
The hair of his head was as white as white wool
or as snow, 
[13]
 and his eyes were like a fiery flame. 
15
His feet were like polished brass refined in a
furnace, 
[14]
 and his voice was like the sound of rushing
water. 
16
In his right hand he held seven stars. 
[15]
A sharp two-edged sword came out of his mouth, and his face shone like the sun
at its brightest. 
17
When I caught sight of him, I fell down at his
feet as though dead. 
[16]
 He touched me with his right hand
and said, "Do not be afraid. I am the first and the last, 
18
the one who lives. Once I was dead, but now I
am alive forever and ever. I hold the keys to death and the netherworld. 
[17]
19
Write down, therefore, what you have seen, and
what is happening, and what will happen afterwards. 
[18]
20
This is the secret meaning 
[19]
of the seven stars you saw in my right hand, and of the seven gold lampstands:
the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands
are the seven churches.

 [1-3] This prologue describes the
source, contents, and audience of the book and forms an inclusion with the
epilogue (
⇒
 Rev 22:6-21), with its similar themes
and expressions. 
2
 [3] Blessed is the one: this is the
first of seven beatitudes in this book; the others are in
⇒
 Rev 14:13; 
⇒
 16:15;
⇒
 19:9; 
⇒
 20:6;
⇒
 22:7,

 14. This
prophetic message: literally, "the words of the prophecy"; so
⇒
 Rev 22:7, 
⇒
 10,
⇒
 18, 
⇒
 19 by
inclusion. The appointed time: when Jesus will return in glory; cf 
⇒
 Rev
1:7;

 3:11;

 22:7,

3
 [4-8] Although Revelation begins
and ends (
⇒
 Rev 22:21) with Christian epistolary
formulae, there is nothing between Rev 4; 22 resembling a letter. The author
here employs the standard word order for greetings in Greek letter writing:
"N. to N., greetings . . ."; see the note on 
⇒
 Romans
1:1.
4
 [4] Seven churches in Asia: Asia
refers to the Roman province of that name in western Asia Minor (modern
Turkey); these representative churches are mentioned by name in
⇒
 Rev 1:11, and each is the recipient of a message
(
⇒
 Rev 2:1-
⇒
 3:22). Seven
is the biblical number suggesting fullness and completeness; thus the seer is
writing for the whole church.
5
 [5] Freed us: the majority of Greek
manuscripts and several early versions read "washed us"; but
"freed us" is supported by the best manuscripts and fits well with
Old Testament imagery, e.g., 
⇒
 Isaiah 40:2.
6
 [8] The Alpha and the Omega: the
first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. In 
⇒
 Rev
22:13 the same words occur together with the expressions "the
First and the Last, the Beginning and the End"; cf 
⇒
 Rev
1:17; 
⇒
 2:8;
⇒
 21:6; 
⇒
 Isaiah 41:4;
⇒
 44:6.
7
 [9-20] In this first vision, the
seer is commanded to write what he sees to the seven churches (
⇒
 Rev
1:9-11). He sees Christ in glory, whom he depicts in stock
apocalyptic imagery (
⇒
 Rev 1:12-16), and hears him
describe himself in terms meant to encourage Christians by emphasizing his
victory over death (
⇒
 Rev 1:17-20).
8
 [9] Island called Patmos: one of
the Sporades islands in the Aegean Sea, some fifty miles south of Ephesus, used
by the Romans as a penal colony. Because I proclaimed God's word: literally,
"on account of God's word."
9
 [10] The Lord's day: Sunday. As
loud as a trumpet: the imagery is derived from the theophany at Sinai
(
⇒
 Exodus 19:16, 
⇒
 19;
cf 
⇒
 Hebrews 12:19 and the trumpet in other
eschatological settings in 
⇒
 Isaiah 27:13;
⇒
 Joel 2:1; 
⇒
 Matthew
24:31; 
⇒
 1 Cor 15:52;
⇒
 1 Thes 4:16).
10
 [11] Scroll: a papyrus roll.
11
 [12-16] A symbolic description of
Christ in glory. The metaphorical language is not to be understood literally;
cf Introduction.
12
 [13] Son of man: see the note on
⇒
 Mark 8:31. Ankle-length robe: Christ is priest; cf
⇒
 Exodus 28:4; 
⇒
 29:5;
⇒
 Wisdom 18:24; 
⇒
 Zechariah
3:4. Gold sash: Christ is king; cf 
⇒
 Exodus
28:4; 
⇒
 1 Macc 10:89;
⇒
 11:58; 
⇒
 Daniel 10:5.
13
 [14] Hair . . . as white as white
wool or as snow: Christ is eternal, clothed with the dignity that belonged to
the "Ancient of Days"; cf 
⇒
 Rev 1:18;
⇒
 Daniel 7:9. His eyes were like a fiery flame:
Christ is portrayed as all-knowing; cf 
⇒
 Rev 2:23;
⇒
 Psalm 7:10; 
⇒
 Jeremiah
17:10; and similar expressions in 
⇒
 Rev
2:18; 
⇒
 19:12; cf
⇒
 Daniel 10:6.
14
 [15] His feet . . . furnace: Christ
is depicted as unchangeable; cf 
⇒
 Ezekiel 1:27;
⇒
 Daniel 10:6. The Greek word translated
"refined" is unconnected grammatically with any other word in the
sentence. His voice . . . water: Christ speaks with divine authority; cf
⇒
 Ezekiel 1:24.
15
 [16] Seven stars: in the pagan
world, Mithras and the Caesars were represented with seven stars in their right
hand, symbolizing their universal dominion. A sharp two-edged sword: this
refers to the word of God (cf 
⇒
 Eph 6:17;
⇒
 Hebrews 4:12) that will destroy unrepentant
sinners; cf 
⇒
 Rev 2:16;
⇒
 19:15; 
⇒
 Wisdom
18:15; 
⇒
 Isaiah 11:4;
⇒
 49:2. His face . . . brightest: this symbolizes
the divine majesty of Christ; cf 
⇒
 Rev 10:1;
⇒
 21:23; 
⇒
 Judges 5:31;
⇒
 Isaiah 60:19; 
⇒
 Matthew
17:2.
16
 [17] It was an Old Testament belief
that for sinful human beings to see God was to die; cf
⇒
 Exodus 19:21;
⇒
 33:20; 
⇒
 Judges
6:22-23; 
⇒
 Isaiah 6:5.
17
 [18] Netherworld: Greek Hades, Hebrew
Sheol, the abode of the dead; cf 
⇒
 Rev 20:13-14;
⇒
 Numbers 16:33.

 [19] What you have seen, and what
is happening, and what will happen afterwards: the three parts of the Book of
Revelation, the vision (
⇒
 Rev 1:10-20), the
situation in the seven churches (Rev 2-3), and the events of Rev 6-22.
19
 [20] Secret meaning: literally,
"mystery." Angels: these are the presiding spirits of the seven
churches. Angels were thought to be in charge of the physical world (cf
⇒
 Rev 7:1; 
⇒
 14:18;
⇒
 16:5) and of nations (
⇒
 Daniel
10:13; 
⇒
 12:1), communities (the seven
churches), and individuals (
⇒
 Matthew 18:10;
⇒
 Acts 12:15). Some have seen in the
"angel" of each of the seven churches its pastor or a personification
of the spirit of the congregation.
