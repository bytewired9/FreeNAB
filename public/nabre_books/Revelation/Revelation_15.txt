 Then I saw in heaven another sign, 
[2]
great and awe-inspiring: seven angels with the seven last plagues, for through
them God's fury is accomplished. 
2
Then I saw something like a sea of glass
mingled with fire. 
[3]
 On the sea of glass were standing those
who had won the victory over the beast and its image and the number that
signified its name. They were holding God's harps, 
3
and they sang the song of Moses, 
[4]
the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb: "Great and wonderful are
your works, Lord God almighty. Just and true are your ways, O king of the
nations. 
4
Who will not fear you, Lord, or glorify your
name? For you alone are holy. All the nations will come and worship before you,
for your righteous acts have been revealed." 
5
[5]
 After this I had another vision. The temple
that is the heavenly tent of testimony 
[6]
 opened, 
6
and the seven angels with the seven plagues came
out of the temple. They were dressed in clean white linen, with a gold sash
around their chests. 
7
One of the four living creatures gave the seven
angels seven gold bowls filled with the fury of God, who lives forever and
ever. 
8
Then the temple became so filled with the smoke
from God's glory and might that no one could enter it until the seven plagues
of the seven angels had been accomplished.

seven bowls, the third and last group of seven after the seven seals and the
seven trumpets, foreshadow the final cataclysm. Again, the series is introduced
by a heavenly prelude, in which the victors over the beast sing the canticle of
Moses (

 Rev 15:2-4).

symbolizes the sanctity involved in facing God, reflected in the trials that
have prepared the victorious Christians or in God's wrath.

that Moses and the Israelites sang after their escape from the oppression of
Egypt (

 Exodus 15:1-18). The martyrs have escaped
from the oppression of the Devil. Nations: many other Greek manuscripts and
