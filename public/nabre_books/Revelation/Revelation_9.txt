[1]
 Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I
saw a star 
[2]
 that had fallen from the sky to the earth. It
was given the key for the passage to the abyss. 
2
It opened the passage to the abyss, and smoke
came up out of the passage like smoke from a huge furnace. The sun and the air
were darkened by the smoke from the passage. 
3
Locusts came out of the smoke onto the land,
and they were given the same power as scorpions 
[3]
 of the
earth. 
4
They were told not to harm the grass of the
earth or any plant or any tree, but only those people who did not have the seal
of God on their foreheads. 
5
They were not allowed to kill them but only to
torment them for five months; 
[4]
 the torment they inflicted
was like that of a scorpion when it stings a person. 
6
During that time these people will seek death
but will not find it, and they will long to die but death will escape them. 
7
[5]
 The appearance of the locusts was like that of
horses ready for battle. On their heads they wore what looked like crowns of
gold; their faces were like human faces, 
8
and they had hair like women's hair. Their
teeth were like lions' teeth, 
9
and they had chests like iron breastplates. The
sound of their wings was like the sound of many horse-drawn chariots racing
into battle. 
10
They had tails like scorpions, with stingers;
with their tails they had power to harm people for five months. 
11
They had as their king the angel of the abyss,
whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon 
[6]
 and in Greek Apollyon. 
12
The first woe has passed, but there are two
more to come. 
13
[7]
 Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I
heard a voice coming from the [four] 
[8]
 horns of the gold
altar before God, 
14
telling the sixth angel who held the trumpet,
"Release the four angels 
[9]
 who are bound at the banks
of the great river Euphrates." 
15
So the four angels were released, who were
prepared for this hour, day, month, and year to kill a third of the human race.
16
The number of cavalry troops was two hundred
million; I heard their number. 
17
Now in my vision this is how I saw the horses
and their riders. They wore red, blue, 
[10]
 and yellow
breastplates, and the horses' heads were like heads of lions, and out of their
mouths came fire, smoke, and sulfur. 
18
By these three plagues of fire, smoke, and
sulfur that came out of their mouths a third of the human race was killed. 
19
For the power of the horses is in their mouths
and in their tails; for their tails are like snakes, with heads that inflict
harm. 
20
The rest of the human race, who were not killed
by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, 
[11]
to give up the worship of demons and idols made from gold, silver, bronze,
stone, and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk. 
21
Nor did they repent of their murders, their
magic potions, their unchastity, or their robberies. 
1
 [1-12] The fifth trumpet heralds a
woe containing elements from the eighth and ninth plagues of Egypt
(
⇒
 Exodus 10:12-15,
⇒
 21-23) but specifically reminiscent of the
invasion of locusts in 
⇒
 Joel
1:4-
⇒
 2:10.
2
 [1] A star: late Judaism
represented fallen powers as stars (
⇒
 Isaiah
14:12-15; 
⇒
 Luke 10:18;
⇒
 Jude 1:13), but a comparison with
⇒
 Rev 1:20 and 
⇒
 Rev 20:1
suggests that here it means an angel. The passage to the abyss: referring to
Sheol, the netherworld, where Satan and the fallen angels are kept for a
thousand years, to be cast afterwards into the pool of fire; cf
⇒
 Rev 20:7-10. The abyss was conceived of as a vast
subterranean cavern full of fire. Its only link with the earth was a kind of
passage or mine shaft, which was kept locked. 
3
 [3] Scorpions: their poisonous
sting was proverbial; 
⇒
 Ezekiel 2:6;
⇒
 Luke 11:12.
4
 [5] For five months: more or less
corresponding to the life-span of locusts.
5
 [7-10] Eight characteristics are
listed to show the eschatological and diabolical nature of these locusts.
6
 [11] Abaddon: Hebrew (more
precisely, Aramaic) for destruction or ruin. Apollyon: Greek for the
"Destroyer."
7
 [13-21] The sixth trumpet heralds a
woe representing another diabolical attack symbolized by an invasion by the
Parthians living east of the Euphrates; see the note on 
⇒
 Rev
6:2. At the appointed time (
⇒
 Rev 9:15),
the frightful horses act as God's agents of judgment. The imaginative details
are not to be taken literally; see Introduction and the note on
⇒
 Rev 6:12-14.
8
 [13] [Four]: many Greek manuscripts
and versions omit the word. The horns were situated at the four corners of the
altar (
⇒
 Exodus 27:2;
⇒
 30:2-3); see the note on 
⇒
 Rev
8:3.
9
 [14-15] The four angels: they are
symbolic of the destructive activity that will be extended throughout the
universe.
10
 [17] Blue: literally,
"hyacinth-colored." Yellow: literally, "sulfurous."
11
 [20] The works of their hands:
i.e., the gods their hands had made.
