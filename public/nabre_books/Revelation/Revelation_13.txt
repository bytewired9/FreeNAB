[1]
 Then I saw a beast come out of the sea with
ten horns and seven heads; on its horns were ten diadems, and on its heads
blasphemous name (s). 
2
The beast I saw was like a leopard, but it had feet
like a bear's, and its mouth was like the mouth of a lion. 
[2]
To it the dragon gave its own power and throne, along with great authority. 
3
I saw that one of its heads seemed to have been
mortally wounded, but this mortal wound was healed. 
[3]
Fascinated, the whole world followed after the beast. 
4
They worshiped the dragon because it gave its
authority to the beast; they also worshiped the beast 
[4]
 and
said, "Who can compare with the beast or who can fight against it?" 
5
[5]
[6]
 The beast was given a
mouth uttering proud boasts and blasphemies, and it was given authority to act
for forty-two months. 
6
It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies
against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling and those who dwell in
heaven. 
7
It was also allowed to wage war against the
holy ones and conquer them, and it was granted authority over every tribe,
people, tongue, and nation. 
8
All the inhabitants of the earth will worship
it, all whose names were not written from the foundation of the world in the
book of life, which belongs to the Lamb who was slain. 
9
Whoever has ears ought to hear these words. 
10
Anyone destined for captivity goes into
captivity. Anyone destined to be slain by the sword shall be slain by the
sword. Such is the faithful endurance of the holy ones. 
11
[7]
 Then I saw another beast come up out of the
earth; it had two horns like a lamb's but spoke like a dragon. 
12
It wielded all the authority of the first beast
in its sight and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast,
whose mortal wound had been healed. 
13
It performed great signs, even making fire come
down from heaven to earth in the sight of everyone. 
14
It deceived the inhabitants of the earth with
the signs it was allowed to perform in the sight of the first beast, telling
them to make an image for the beast who had been wounded by the sword and
revived. 
15
It was then permitted to breathe life into the
beast's image, so that the beast's image could speak and (could) have anyone
who did not worship it put to death. 
16
It forced all the people, small and great, rich
and poor, free and slave, to be given a stamped image on their right hands or
their foreheads, 
17
so that no one could buy or sell except one who
had the stamped image of the beast's name or the number that stood for its
name. 
18
[8]
 Wisdom is needed here; one who understands can
calculate the number of the beast, for it is a number that stands for a person.
His number is six hundred and sixty-six.

 [1-10] This wild beast, combining
features of the four beasts in 
⇒
 Daniel 7:2-28,
symbolizes the Roman empire; the seven heads represent the emperors; see the
notes on 
⇒
 Rev 17:10 and 
⇒
 Rev
17:12-14. The blasphemous names are the divine titles assumed by the
emperors. 
2
 [2] Satan (
⇒
 Rev
12:9), the prince of this world (
⇒
 John
12:31), commissioned the beast to persecute the church
(
⇒
 Rev 13:5-7).
3
 [3] This may be a reference to the
popular legend that Nero would come back to life and rule again after his death
(which occurred in A.D. 68 from a self-inflicted stab wound in the throat); cf
⇒
 Rev 13:14; 
⇒
 Rev 17:8.
Domitian (A.D. 81-96) embodied all the cruelty and impiety of Nero. Cf
Introduction.
4
 [4] Worshiped the beast: allusion
to emperor worship, which Domitian insisted upon and ruthlessly enforced. Who
can compare with the beast: perhaps a deliberate parody of the name Michael;
see the note on 
⇒
 Rev 12:7.
5
 [5-6] Domitian, like Antiochus IV
Epiphanes (
⇒
 Daniel 7:8,
⇒
 11, 
⇒
 25), demanded
that he be called by divine titles such as "our lord and god" and
"Jupiter." See the note on 
⇒
 Rev 11:2.
6
 [5] Forty-two months: this is the
same duration as the profanation of the holy city (
⇒
 Rev
11:2), the prophetic mission of the two witnesses
(
⇒
 Rev 11:3), and the retreat of the woman into the
desert (
⇒
 Rev 12:6,
⇒
 14).
7
 [11-18] The second beast is
described in terms of the false prophets (cf 
⇒
 Rev
16:13; 
⇒
 19:20;
⇒
 20:10) who accompany the false messiahs (the
first beast); cf 
⇒
 Matthew 24:24;
⇒
 Mark 13:22; 
⇒
 2 Thes
2:9; cf also 
⇒
 Deut 13:2-4. Christians had
either to worship the emperor and his image or to suffer martyrdom.

 [18] Each of the letters of the
alphabet in Hebrew as well as in Greek has a numerical value. Many possible
combinations of letters will add up to 666, and many candidates have been
nominated for this infamous number. The most likely is the emperor Caesar Nero
(see the note on 
⇒
 Rev 13:3), the Greek form of
whose name in Hebrew letters gives the required sum. (The Latin form of this
name equals 616, which is the reading of a few manuscripts.) Nero personifies
the emperors who viciously persecuted the church. It has also been observed
that "6" represents imperfection, falling short of the perfect number
"7," and is represented here in a triple or superlative form.
