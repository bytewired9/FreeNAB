1
Then the angel showed me the river of
life-giving water, 
[1]
 sparkling like crystal, flowing from
the throne of God and of the Lamb 
2
down the middle of its street. On either side
of the river grew the tree of life 
[2]
 that produces fruit
twelve times a year, once each month; the leaves of the trees serve as medicine
for the nations. 
3
Nothing accursed will be found there anymore.
The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship
him. 
4
They will look upon his face, 
[3]
and his name will be on their foreheads. 
5
Night will be no more, nor will they need light
from lamp or sun, for the Lord God shall give them light, and they shall reign
forever and ever. 
6
[4]
 And he said to me, "These words are
trustworthy and true, and the Lord, the God of prophetic spirits, sent his
angel to show his servants what must happen soon." 
7
[5]
 "Behold, I am coming soon." 
[6]
Blessed is the one who keeps the prophetic message of this book. 
8
It is I, John, who heard and saw these things,
and when I heard and saw them I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel
who showed them to me. 
9
But he said to me, "Don't! I am a fellow
servant of yours and of your brothers the prophets and of those who keep the
message of this book. Worship God." 
10
Then he said to me, "Do not seal up the
prophetic words of this book, for the appointed time 
[7]
 is
near. 
11
Let the wicked still act wickedly, and the
filthy still be filthy. The righteous must still do right, and the holy still
be holy." 
12
"Behold, I am coming soon. I bring with me
the recompense I will give to each according to his deeds. 
13
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the
last, the beginning and the end." 
[8]
14
Blessed are they who wash their robes so as to
have the right to the tree of life and enter the city 
[9]
through its gates. 
15
Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the
unchaste, the murderers, the idol-worshipers, and all who love and practice
deceit. 
16
"I, Jesus, sent my angel to give you this
testimony for the churches. I am the root and offspring of David, 
[10]
the bright morning star." 
17
The Spirit and the bride 
[11]
say, "Come." Let the hearer say, "Come." Let the one who
thirsts come forward, and the one who wants it receive the gift of life-giving
water. 
18
I warn everyone who hears the prophetic words
in this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described
in this book, 
19
and if anyone takes away from the words in this
prophetic book, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the
holy city described in this book. 
20
[12]
 The one who gives this testimony says,
"Yes, I am coming soon." Amen! Come, Lord Jesus! 
21
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all.
