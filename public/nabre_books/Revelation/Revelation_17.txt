[1]
 Then one of the seven angels who were holding
the seven bowls came and said to me, "Come here. I will show you the
judgment on the great harlot 
[2]
 who lives near the many
waters. 
2
[3]
 The kings of the earth have had intercourse
with her, and the inhabitants of the earth became drunk on the wine of her
harlotry." 
3
Then he carried me away in spirit to a deserted
place where I saw a woman seated on a scarlet beast 
[4]
 that
was covered with blasphemous names, with seven heads and ten horns. 
4
The woman was wearing purple and scarlet and
adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls. She held in her hand a gold cup
that was filled with the abominable and sordid deeds of her harlotry. 
5
On her forehead was written a name, which is a
mystery, "Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and of the abominations
of the earth." 
6
[5]
 I saw that the woman was drunk on the blood of
the holy ones and on the blood of the witnesses to Jesus. 
[6]
When I saw her I was greatly amazed. 
7
The angel said to me, "Why are you amazed?
I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries
her, the beast with the seven heads and the ten horns. 
8
[7]
 The beast that you saw existed once but now
exists no longer. It will come up from the abyss and is headed for destruction.
The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of
life from the foundation of the world shall be amazed when they see the beast,
because it existed once but exists no longer, and yet it will come again. 
9
Here is a clue 
[8]
 for one who
has wisdom. The seven heads represent seven hills upon which the woman sits.
They also represent seven kings: 
10
five have already fallen, one still lives, and
the last has not yet come, 
[9]
 and when he comes he must
remain only a short while. 
11
The beast 
[10]
 that existed
once but exists no longer is an eighth king, but really belongs to the seven
and is headed for destruction. 
12
The ten horns that you saw represent ten kings
who have not yet been crowned; 
[11]
 they will receive royal authority
along with the beast for one hour. 
13
They are of one mind and will give their power
and authority to the beast. 
14
They will fight with the Lamb, but the Lamb
will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and king of kings, and those with
him are called, chosen, and faithful." 
15
Then he said to me, "The waters that you
saw where the harlot lives represent large numbers of peoples, nations, and
tongues. 
16
The ten horns 
[12]
 that you
saw and the beast will hate the harlot; they will leave her desolate and naked;
they will eat her flesh and consume her with fire. 
17
For God has put it into their minds to carry
out his purpose and to make them come to an agreement to give their kingdom to
the beast until the words of God are accomplished. 
18
The woman whom you saw represents the great
city that has sovereignty over the kings of the earth." 
1
 [1-6] Babylon, the symbolic name
(
⇒
 Rev 17:5) of Rome, is graphically described as
"the great harlot."
2
[
⇒
 17:1-
⇒
 19:10] The
punishment of Babylon is now described as a past event and, metaphorically,
under the image of the great harlot who leads people astray into idolatry. 
3
 [2] Intercourse . . . harlotry: see
the note on 
⇒
 Rev 14:4. The pagan kings subject to
Rome adopted the cult of the emperor.
4
 [3] Scarlet beast: see the note on
⇒
 Rev 13:1-10. Blasphemous names: divine titles
assumed by the Roman emperors; see the note on 
⇒
 Rev
13:5-6.
5
 [6] Reference to the great wealth
and idolatrous cults of Rome.
6
 [6b-18] An interpretation of the
vision is here given.
7
 [8] Allusion to the belief that the
dead Nero would return to power (
⇒
 Rev 17:11); see
the note on 
⇒
 Rev 13:3.
8
 [9] Here is a clue: literally,
"Here a mind that has wisdom." Seven hills: of Rome.
9
 [10] There is little agreement as
to the identity of the Roman emperors alluded to here. The number seven
(
⇒
 Rev 17:9) suggests that all the emperors are
meant; see the note on 
⇒
 Rev 1:4.
10
 [11] The beast: Nero; see the note
on 
⇒
 Rev 17:8.
11
 [12-13] Ten kings who have not yet
been crowned: perhaps Parthian satraps who are to accompany the revived Nero
(the beast) in his march on Rome to regain power; see the note on
⇒
 Rev 13:3. In 
⇒
 Rev
19:11-21, the Lamb and his companions will conquer them.
12
 [16-18] The ten horns: the ten
pagan kings (
⇒
 Rev 17:12) who unwittingly fulfill
God's will against harlot Rome, the great city; cf 
⇒
 Ezekiel
16:37.
