 "To the angel of the
church 
[3]
 in Ephesus, write this: " 'The one who holds
the seven stars in his right hand and walks in the midst of the seven gold
lampstands says this: 
2
"I know your works, your labor, and your
endurance, and that you cannot tolerate the wicked; you have tested those who
call themselves apostles but are not, and discovered that they are impostors. 
[4]
3
Moreover, you have endurance and have suffered
for my name, and you have not grown weary. 
4
Yet I hold this against you: you have lost the
love you had at first. 
5
Realize how far you have fallen. Repent, and do
the works you did at first. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your
lampstand from its place, unless you repent. 
6
But you have this in your favor: you hate the
works of the Nicolaitans, 
[5]
 which I also hate. 
7
" '"Whoever has ears ought to hear
what the Spirit says to the churches. To the victor 
[6]
 I will
give the right to eat from the tree of life that is in the garden of
God."' 
8
[7]
 "To the angel of the church in Smyrna, 
[8]
write this: " 'The first and the last, who once died but came to life,
says this: 
9
"I know your tribulation and poverty, but
you are rich. 
[9]
 I know the slander of those who claim to be
Jews and are not, but rather are members of the assembly of Satan. 
10
Do not be afraid of anything that you are going
to suffer. Indeed, the devil will throw some of you into prison, that you may
be tested, and you will face an ordeal for ten days. Remain faithful until
death, and I will give you the crown of life. 
11
" '"Whoever has ears ought to hear
what the Spirit says to the churches. The victor shall not be harmed by the
second death."' 
[10]
12
[11]
 "To the angel of the church in Pergamum, 
[12]
write this: " 'The one with the sharp two-edged sword says this: 
13
"I know that you live where Satan's throne
[13]
 is, and yet you hold fast to my name and have not denied
your faith in me, not even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was
martyred among you, where Satan lives. 
14
[14]
 Yet I have a few things against you. You have
some people there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who instructed Balak to
put a stumbling block before the Israelites: to eat food sacrificed to idols
and to play the harlot. 
15
Likewise, you also have some people who hold to
the teaching of (the) Nicolaitans. 
16
Therefore, repent. Otherwise, I will come to
you quickly and wage war against them with the sword of my mouth. 
17
" '"Whoever has ears ought to hear
what the Spirit says to the churches. To the victor I shall give some of the
hidden manna; 
[15]
 I shall also give a white amulet upon which
is inscribed a new name, which no one knows except the one who receives
it."' 
18
[16]
 "To the angel of the church in Thyatira, 
[17]
write this: " 'The Son of God, whose eyes are like a fiery flame and whose
feet are like polished brass, says this: 
19
"I know your works, your love, faith,
service, and endurance, and that your last works are greater than the first. 
20
Yet I hold this against you, that you tolerate
the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, who teaches and misleads my
servants to play the harlot and to eat food sacrificed to idols. 
[18]
21
I have given her time to repent, but she
refuses to repent of her harlotry. 
22
So I will cast her on a sickbed and plunge
those who commit adultery with her into intense suffering unless they repent of
her works. 
23
I will also put her children 
[19]
to death. Thus shall all the churches come to know that I am the searcher of
hearts and minds and that I will give each of you what your works deserve. 
24
But I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, who
do not uphold this teaching and know nothing of the so-called deep secrets of
Satan: 
[20]
 on you I will place no further burden, 
25
except that you must hold fast to what you have
until I come. 
26
" '"To the victor, 
[21]
who keeps to my ways 
[22]
 until the end, I will give authority
over the nations. 
27
He will rule them with an iron rod. Like clay
vessels will they be smashed, 
28
just as I received authority from my Father.
And to him I will give the morning star. 
29
" '"Whoever has ears ought to hear
what the Spirit says to the churches."'

[
⇒
 2:1-
⇒
 3:22] Each of the
seven letters follows the same pattern: address; description of the exalted
Christ; blame and/or praise for the church addressed; threat and/or admonition;
final exhortation and promise to all Christians.
2
 [1-7] The letter to Ephesus praises
the members of the church there for their works and virtues, including
discerning false teachers (
⇒
 Rev 2:2-3), but admonishes
them to repent and return to their former devotion (
⇒
 Rev
2:4-5). It concludes with a reference to the Nicolaitans (see the
note on 
⇒
 Rev 2:6) and a promise that the victor will
have access to eternal life (
⇒
 Rev 2:7).
3
 [1] Ephesus: this great ancient
city had a population of ca. 250,000; it was the capital of the Roman province
of Asia and the commercial, cultural, and religious center of Asia. The other
six churches were located in the same province, situated roughly in a circle;
they were selected for geographical reasons rather than for the size of their
Christian communities. Walks in the midst of the seven gold lampstands: this
signifies that Christ is always present in the church; see the note on
⇒
 Rev 1:4. 
4
 [2] Who call themselves . . .
impostors: this refers to unauthorized and perverse missionaries; cf
⇒
 Acts 20:29-30.
5
 [6] Nicolaitans: these are perhaps
the impostors of 
⇒
 Rev 2:2; see the note on
⇒
 Rev 2:14-15. There is little evidence for
connecting this group with Nicolaus, the proselyte from Antioch, mentioned in
⇒
 Acts 6:5.
6
 [7] Victor: referring to any
Christian individual who holds fast to the faith and does God's will in the
face of persecution. The tree of life that is in the garden of God: this is a
reference to the tree in the primeval paradise (
⇒
 Genesis
2:9); cf 
⇒
 Rev 22:2,
⇒
 14, 
⇒
 19. The decree
excluding humanity from the tree of life has been revoked by Christ.
7
 [8-11] The letter to Smyrna
encourages the Christians in this important commercial center by telling them
that although they are impoverished, they are nevertheless rich, and calls
those Jews who are slandering them members of the assembly of Satan (
⇒
 Rev
2:9). There is no admonition; rather, the Christians are told that
they will suffer much, even death, but the time of tribulation will be short
compared to their eternal reward (
⇒
 Rev 2:10), and
they will thus escape final damnation (
⇒
 Rev 2:11).
8
 [8] Smyrna: modern Izmir, ca.
thirty miles north of Ephesus, and the chief city of Lydia, with a temple to
the goddess Roma. It was renowned for its loyalty to Rome, and it also had a
large Jewish community very hostile toward Christians.
9
 [9-10] The church in Smyrna was
materially poor but spiritually rich. Accusations made by Jewish brethren there
occasioned the persecution of Christians; cf 
⇒
 Acts
14:2, 
⇒
 19;
⇒
 17:5, 
⇒
 13.
10
 [11] The second death: this refers
to the eternal death, when sinners will receive their final punishment; cf
⇒
 Rev 20:6, 
⇒
 14-15;
⇒
 21:8.
11
 [12-17] The letter to Pergamum
praises the members of the church for persevering in their faith in Christ even
in the midst of a pagan setting and in face of persecution and martyrdom
(
⇒
 Rev 2:13). But it admonishes them about members
who advocate an unprincipled morality (
⇒
 Rev 2:14;
cf 
⇒
 2 Peter 2:15; 
⇒
 Jude
1:11) and others who follow the teaching of the Nicolaitans
(
⇒
 Rev 2:15; see the note there). It urges them to
repent (
⇒
 Rev 2:16) and promises them the hidden
manna and Christ's amulet (
⇒
 Rev 2:17).
12
 [12] Pergamum: modern Bergama, ca.
forty-five miles northeast of Smyrna, a center for various kinds of pagan
worship. It also had an outstanding library (the word parchment is derived from
its name).
13
 [13] Satan's throne: the reference
is to emperor worship and other pagan practices that flourished in Pergamum,
perhaps specifically to the white marble altar erected and dedicated to Zeus by
Eumenes II (197-160 B.C.).
14
 [14-15] Like Balaam, the biblical
prototype of the religious compromiser (cf 
⇒
 Numbers
25:1-3; 
⇒
 31:16; 
⇒
 2
Peter 2:15; 
⇒
 Jude 1:11), the Nicolaitans
in Pergamum and Ephesus (
⇒
 Rev 2:6) accommodated
their Christian faith to paganism. They abused the principle of liberty
enunciated by Paul (
⇒
 1 Cor 9:19-23).
15
 [17] The hidden manna: this is the
food of life; cf 
⇒
 Psalm 78:24-25. White amulet:
literally, "white stone," on which was written a magical name, whose
power could be tapped by one who knew the secret name. It is used here as a
symbol of victory and joy; cf 
⇒
 Rev 3:4-5. New name:
this is a reference to the Christian's rebirth in Christ; cf
⇒
 Rev 3:12; 
⇒
 19:12;
⇒
 Isaiah 62:2; 
⇒
 65:15.
16
 [18-29] The letter to Thyatira
praises the progress in virtue of this small Christian community
(
⇒
 Rev 2:19) but admonishes them for tolerating a
false prophet who leads them astray (
⇒
 Rev 2:20).
Her fate is sealed, but there is hope of repentance for her followers
(
⇒
 Rev 2:21-22). Otherwise, they too shall die
(
⇒
 Rev 2:23). They are warned against Satanic power
or knowledge (
⇒
 Rev 2:24-25). Those who remain
faithful will share in the messianic reign, having authority over nations
(
⇒
 Rev 2:26-27), and will in fact possess Christ
himself (
⇒
 Rev 2:8).
17
 [18] Thyatira: modern Akhisar, ca.
forty miles southeast of Pergamum, a frontier town famous for its workers'
guilds (cf 
⇒
 Acts 16:14), membership in which may
have involved festal meals in pagan temples.
18
 [20] The scheming and treacherous
Jezebel of old (cf 
⇒
 1 Kings 19:1-2;
⇒
 21:1-14; 
⇒
 2 Kings
9:22, 
⇒
 30-34) introduced pagan customs
into the religion of Israel; this new Jezebel was doing the same to
Christianity.
19
 [23] Children: spiritual
descendants.
20
 [24] The so-called deep secrets of
Satan: literally, "the deep things of Satan," a scathing reference to
the perverse teaching of the Nicolaitans (
⇒
 Rev
2:15).
21
 [26-28] The Christian who
perseveres in faith will share in Christ's messianic authority (cf
⇒
 Psalm 2:8-9) and resurrection victory over death,
symbolized by the morning star; cf 
⇒
 Rev 22:16.
22
 [26] Who keeps to my ways:
literally, "who keeps my works."
