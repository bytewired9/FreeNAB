Introduction
This prophecy
dates from the years 605-597 B.C., or between the great Babylonian victory at
Carchemish and Nebuchadnezzar's invasion of Judah which culminated in the
capture of Jerusalem. The situation of Judah was desperate at this time, with
political intrigue and idolatry widespread in the small kingdom. The first two
chapters consist of a dialogue between the prophet and the Lord. For what may
be the first time in Israelite literature, a man questions the ways of God, as
Habakkuk calls him to account for his government of the world. To this question
God replies that he has prepared a chastising rod, Babylon, which will be the
avenging instrument in his hand. There is added the divine assurance that the
just Israelite will not perish in the calamities about to be visited on the nation.
The third chapter is a
magnificent religious lyric, filled with reminiscences of Israel's past and
rich in literary borrowings from the poetry of ancient Canaan, though still
expressing authentic Israelite faith. God appears in all his majestic splendor
and executes vengeance on Judah's enemies. The prophecy ends with a joyous
profession of confidence in the Lord, the Savior.
