Introduction
This work was
composed by an anonymous writer shortly before Nehemiah's arrival in Jerusalem
(445 B.C.). Because of the sharp reproaches he was leveling against the priests
and rulers of the people, the author probably wished to conceal his identity.
To do this he made a proper name out of the Hebrew expression for "My
Messenger" (Malachi), which occurs in 
⇒
1:1; 
⇒
 3:1. The historical value of the
prophecy is considerable in that it gives us a picture of life in the Jewish
community returned from Babylon, between the period of Haggai and the reform
measures of Ezra and Nehemiah. It is likely that the author's trenchant
criticism of abuses and religious indifference in the community prepared the
way for these necessary reforms.
The chosen
people had made a sorry return for divine love. The priests, who should have
been leaders, had dishonored God by their blemished sacrifices. In his first
chapter, the writer foresees the time when all nations will offer a pure
oblation (
⇒
 Malachi 1:11)-a prophecy whose
fulfillment the Church sees in the Sacrifice of the Mass. The author then turns
from priests to people, denouncing their marriages with pagans and their
callous repudiation of Israelite wives. Imbued with the rationalist and
critical spirit of the times, many had wearied God with the question,
"Where is the God of justice?" To this question the prophet replies
that the day of the Lord is coming. But first the forerunner must come, who
will prepare the soil for repentance and true worship. The Gospel writers point
to John the Baptizer, as the forerunner ushering in the messianic age, the true
day of the Lord. When the ground is prepared God will appear, measuring out
rewards and punishments and purifying the nation in the furnace of judgment. He
will create a new order in which the ultimate triumph of good is inevitable.
