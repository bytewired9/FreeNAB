[1]
 Lo, I am sending my messenger to prepare the
way before me; And suddenly there will come to the temple the LORD whom you
seek, And the messenger of the covenant whom you desire. Yes, he is coming,
says the LORD of hosts. 
2
But who will endure the day of his coming? And
who can stand when he appears? For he is like the refiner's fire, or like the
fuller's lye. 
3
He will sit refining and purifying (silver),
and he will purify the sons of Levi, Refining them like gold or like silver
that they may offer due sacrifice to the LORD. 
4
Then the sacrifice of Judah and Jerusalem will
please the LORD, as in days of old, as in years gone by. 
5
I will draw near to you for judgment, and I
will be swift to bear witness Against the sorcerers, adulterers, and perjurers,
those who defraud the hired man of his wages, Against those who defraud widows
and orphans; those who turn aside the stranger, and those who do not fear me,
says the LORD of hosts. 
6
[2]
 Surely I, the LORD, do not change, nor do you
cease to be sons of Jacob. 
7
Since the days of your fathers you have turned
aside from my statutes, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return
to you, says the LORD of hosts. Yet you say, "How must we return?" 
8
Dare a man rob God? Yet you are robbing me! And
you say, "How do we rob you?" In tithes and in offerings! 
9
You are indeed accursed, for you, the whole
nation, rob me. 
10
[3]
 Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse,
That there may be food in my house, and try me in this, says the LORD of hosts:
Shall I not open for you the floodgates of heaven, to pour down blessing upon
you without measure? 
11
For your sake I will forbid the locust to
destroy your crops; And the vine in the field will not be barren, says the LORD
of hosts. 
12
Then all nations will call you blessed, for you
will be a delightful land, says the LORD of hosts. 
13
You have defied me in word, says the LORD, yet
you ask, "What have we spoken against you?" 
14
You have said, "It is vain to serve God,
and what do we profit by keeping his command, And going about in penitential
dress in awe of the LORD of hosts? 
15
Rather must we call the proud blessed; for
indeed evildoers prosper, and even tempt God with impunity." 
16
[4]
 Then they who fear the LORD spoke with one
another, and the LORD listened attentively; And a record book was written
before him of those who fear the LORD and trust in his name. 
17
And they shall be mine, says the LORD of hosts,
my own special possession, on the day I take action. And I will have compassion
on them, as a man has compassion on his son who serves him. 
18
Then you will again see the distinction between
the just and the wicked; Between him who serves God, and him who does not serve
him. 
19
For lo, the day is coming, blazing like an
oven, when all the proud and all evildoers will be stubble, And the day that is
coming will set them on fire, leaving them neither root nor branch, says the
LORD of hosts. 
20
But for you who fear my name, there will arise
the sun of justice with its healing rays; And you will gambol like calves out
of the stall 
21
1) and tread down the wicked; They will become
ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day I take action, says the LORD of
hosts. 
22
Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I
enjoined him on Horeb, The statutes and ordinances for all Israel. 
23
[5]
 Lo, I will send you Elijah, the prophet,
Before the day of the LORD comes, the great and terrible day, 
24
[6]
 To turn the hearts of the fathers to their
children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, Lest I come and
strike the land with doom. Lo, I will send you Elijah, the prophet, Before the
day of the LORD comes, the great and terrible day.

 2 Kings 2:11 as taken heavenward in a fiery
chariot. Here his return to earth seems to be foretold. Jewish tradition has
interpreted this literally; Christ declared it to be fulfilled in the coming of
John the Baptizer (

 Matthew 17:10-13).

 [24] (24)The words in fine print, a
repetition of

 Malachi 3:23 have been added by the
scribes so that the collection of the twelve minor prophets will not end with
the threat of doom.
