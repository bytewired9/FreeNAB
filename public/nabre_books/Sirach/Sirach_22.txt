[1]
 The sluggard is like a stone in the mud;
everyone hisses at his disgrace. 
2
The sluggard is like a lump of dung; whoever
touches him wipes his hands. 
3
An unruly child is a disgrace to its father; if
it be a daughter she brings him to poverty. 
4
A thoughtful daughter becomes a treasure to her
husband, a shameless one is her father's grief. 
5
A hussy shames her father and her husband; by
both she is despised. 
6
[2]
 Like a song in time of mourning is inopportune
talk, but lashes and discipline are at all times wisdom. 
7
Teaching a fool is like gluing a broken pot, or
like disturbing a man in the depths of sleep; 
8
He talks with a slumberer who talks with a
fool, for when it is over, he will say, "What was that?" 
9
Weep over the dead man, for his light has gone
out; weep over the fool, for sense has left him. 
10
Weep but a little over the dead man, for he is at
rest; but worse than death is the life of a fool. 
11
Seven days of mourning for the dead, but for
the wicked fool a whole lifetime. 
12
Speak but seldom with the stupid man, be not
the companion of a brute; 
13
Beware of him lest you have trouble and be
spattered when he shakes himself; Turn away from him and you will find rest and
not be wearied by his lack of sense. 
14
What is heavier than lead, and what is its name
but "Fool"? 
15
Sand and salt and an iron mass are easier to
bear than a stupid man. 
16
[3]
 Masonry bonded with wooden beams is not
loosened by an earthquake; Neither is a resolve constructed with careful
deliberation shaken in a moment of fear. 
17
A resolve that is backed by prudent
understanding is like the polished surface of a smooth wall. 
18
Small stones lying on an open height will not
remain when the wind blows; Neither can a timid resolve based on foolish plans
withstand fear of any kind. 
19
[4]
 One who jabs the eye brings tears: he who
pierces the heart bares its feelings. 
20
He who throws stones at birds drives them away,
and he who insults a friend breaks up the friendship. 
21
Should you draw a sword against a friend,
despair not, it can be undone. 
22
Should you speak sharply to a friend, fear not,
you can be reconciled. But a contemptuous insult, a confidence broken, or a
treacherous attack will drive away any friend. 
23
Make fast friends with a man while he is poor;
thus will you enjoy his prosperity with him. In time of trouble remain true to
him, so as to share in his inheritance when it comes. 
24
Before flames burst forth an oven smokes; so
does abuse come before bloodshed. 
25
From a friend in need of support no one need
hide in shame; 
26
But from him who brings harm to his friend all
will stand aloof who hear of it. 
27
[5]
 Who will set a guard over my mouth, and upon
my lips an effective seal, That I may not fail through them, that my tongue may
not destroy me?

 [1-15] To Sirach, a lazy person and
an unruly child are a cause of shame and disgrace; everyone wishes to be rid of
them (
⇒
 Sirach 22:1-5). A wicked fool is as
senseless as a man asleep or dead, but the grief he causes others lasts a
lifetime (
⇒
 Sirach 22:7-11). He is like a brute,
troublesome and intolerable (
⇒
 Sirach 22:12-15). 
2
 [6] Like a song . . . is . . .
talk: some understand talk in the sense of a rebuke unheeded by the unruly as a
joyful song is out of place among mourners. Corporal punishment, however, is
always effective.
3
 [16-18] A prudent mind firmly
resolved is undisturbed by violent and conflicting thoughts, whereas a foolish
person is tossed about by the winds of fear, like small stones whipped about by
high winds.
4
 [19-26] As disputes and violence
weaken friendship, and disloyalty and abuse of confidence destroy it utterly
(
⇒
 Sirach 22:19-22,
⇒
 24, 
⇒
 26), so
kindness to a poor man in time of poverty and adversity builds up friendship
and merits a share in his prosperity and inheritance
(
⇒
 Sirach 22:23, 
⇒
 25).
5
[
⇒
 22:27-
⇒
 23:6] The
sage implores the divine assistance to preserve him through stern discipline
from sins of the tongue (
⇒
 Sirach 22:27;
⇒
 23:1); ignorance of mind and weakness of will
(
⇒
 Sirach 22:2, 3); and
inclinations of the senses and the flesh, lest he fall into the hands of his
enemies, or become a prey of shameful desires (
⇒
23:3-6).
