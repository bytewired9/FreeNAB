 Valiant leader was JOSHUA, son of Nun,
assistant to Moses in the prophetic office, Formed to be, as his name implies,
the great savior of God's chosen ones, To punish the enemy and to win the
inheritance for Israel. 
2
What glory was his when he raised his arm, to
brandish his javelin against the city! 
3
[2]
 And who could withstand him when he fought the
battles of the LORD? 
4
Did he not by his power stop the sun, so that
one day became two? 
5
He called upon the Most High God when his
enemies beset him on all sides, And God Most High gave answer to him in
hailstones of tremendous power, 
6
Which he rained down upon the hostile army till
on the slope he destroyed the foe; That all the doomed nations might know that
the LORD was watching over his people's battles. And because he was a devoted
follower of God 
7
[3]
 and in Moses' lifetime showed himself loyal, He
and CALEB, son of Jephunneh, when they opposed the rebel assembly, Averted
God's anger from the people and suppressed the wicked complaint -  
8
Because of this, they were the only two spared
from the six hundred thousand infantry, To lead the people into their
inheritance, the land flowing with milk and honey. 
9
And the strength he gave to Caleb remained with
him even in his old age Till he won his way onto the summits of the land; his
family too received an inheritance, 
10
That all the people of Jacob might know how
good it is to be a devoted follower of the LORD. 
11
[4]
 The JUDGES, too, each one of them, whose hearts
were not deceived, Who did not abandon God: may their memory be ever blessed, 
12
Their bones return to life from their resting
place, and their names receive fresh luster in their children! 
13
Beloved of his people, dear to his Maker,
dedicated from his mother's womb, Consecrated to the LORD as a prophet, was
SAMUEL, the judge and priest. At God's word he established the kingdom and
anointed princes to rule the people. 
14
By the law of the LORD he judged the nation,
when he visited the encampments of Jacob. 
15
As a trustworthy prophet he was sought out and
his words proved him true as a seer. 
16
He, too, called upon God, and offered him a
suckling lamb; 
17
Then the LORD thundered forth from heaven, and
the tremendous roar of his voice was heard. 
18
He brought low the rulers of the enemy and
destroyed all the lords of the Philistines. 
19
When Samuel approached the end of his life, he
testified before the LORD and his anointed prince, "No bribe or secret
gift have I taken from any man!" and no one dared gainsay him. 
20
Even when he lay buried, his guidance was
sought; he made known to the king his fate, And from the grave he raised his
voice as a prophet, to put an end to wickedness.

 [1-6] Joshua, whose name means
"the Lord is savior" (
⇒
 Sirach 46:1), was
the instrument through which God delivered his people in miraculous ways
(
⇒
 Sirach 46:2-6) by destroying their enemies, whose
land he gave to the Israelites as an inheritance (
⇒
46:1).

 [7-10] Caleb, who with Joshua
advised Moses and the people in the desert to conquer Canaan, despite the counsel
of their companion scouts and the rebellion of the people, merited to lead the
Israelites of the succeeding generation into the Promised Land. Caleb in his
old age received as his inheritance a portion of land which he himself had
previously conquered; cf

 Joshua 15:13-14.

 [11-20] Of the Judges praised and
blessed for their fidelity to God in opposing idolatry, Samuel, a man of
spotless integrity, was the greatest (
⇒
46:11-12, 
⇒
 19). He was judge of the
entire nation, and was also a prophet and priest who through his sacrificial
offering obtained victory over the Philistines. He established the kingdom,
anointed kings (
⇒
 Sirach 46:13-18), and even after
his death foretold the king's fate and put an end to wickedness
(
⇒
 Sirach 46:20).
