[1]
 With three things I am delighted, for they are
pleasing to the LORD and to men: Harmony among brethren, friendship among
neighbors, and the mutual love of husband and wife. 
2
Three kinds of men I hate; their manner of life
I loathe indeed: A proud pauper, a rich dissembler, and an old man lecherous in
his dotage. 
3
What you have not saved in your youth, how will
you acquire in your old age? 
4
How becoming to the gray-haired is judgment,
and a knowledge of counsel to those on in years! 
5
How becoming to the aged is wisdom,
understanding and prudence to the venerable! 
6
The crown of old men is wide experience; their
glory, the fear of the LORD. 
7
There are nine who come to my mind as blessed,
a tenth whom my tongue proclaims: The man who finds joy in his children, and he
who lives to see his enemies' downfall. 
8
[2]
 Happy is he who dwells with a sensible wife,
and he who plows not like a donkey yoked with an ox. Happy is he who sins not
with his tongue, and he who serves not his inferior. 
9
Happy is he who finds a friend and he who
speaks to attentive ears. 
10
He who finds wisdom is great indeed, but not
greater than he who fears the LORD. 
11
Fear of the LORD surpasses all else. its
possessor is beyond compare. 
12
[3]
 Worst of all wounds is that of the heart,
worst of all evils is that of a woman. 
13
Worst of all sufferings is that from one's
foes, worst of all vengeance is that of one's enemies: 
14
No poison worse than that of a serpent, no
venom greater than that of a woman. 
15
With a dragon or a lion I would rather dwell
than live with an evil woman. 
16
Wickedness changes a woman's looks, and makes
her sullen as a female bear. 
17
When her husband sits among his neighbors, a
bitter sigh escapes him unawares. 
18
There is scarce any evil like that in a woman;
may she fall to the lot of the sinner! 
19
Like a sandy hill to aged feet is a railing
wife to a quiet man. 
20
Stumble not through woman's beauty, nor be
greedy for her wealth; 
21
The man is a slave, in disgrace and shame, when
a wife supports her husband. 
22
Depressed mind, saddened face, broken heart -
this from an evil wife. Feeble hands and quaking knees -  from a wife who brings no happiness to her
husband. 
23
[4]
 In woman was sin's beginning, and because of
her we all die. 
24
Allow water no outlet, and be not indulgent to
an erring wife. 
25
If she walks not by your side, cut her away
from you.

 [1-11] While praising brotherly
love, love of neighbor, and conjugal love, the sage condemns their opposites in
the arrogant pauper who despises his brother, the fraudulent rich man who
cheats his neighbor, and the lecherous old man unfaithful to his wife
(
⇒
 Sirach 25:1, 2).
This last, sensual from his youth, lacks the mature blessings of judgment and
wisdom in old age (
⇒
 Sirach 25:3-6) and the joy of a
peaceful household, where honesty and dignity, friendship, wisdom and fear of
God prevail (
⇒
 Sirach 25:7-11). 
2
 [8] Like a donkey yoked with an ox:
incompatibility between husband and wife.
3
 [12-25] Wickedness in a woman is
most grievous, painful and bitter to her husband. Through it she becomes
vengeful, dangerous and intolerable, jealous, talkative, intemperate and
unchaste. Even her very appearance is changed (
⇒
25:12-17). The worst of all evils, a source of grief, a snare and a
disgrace to her husband, she depresses his mind, saddens and breaks his heart,
destroys his strength (
⇒
 Sirach 25:18-22). She must
not be indulged but made obedient or punished (
⇒
25:24, 
⇒
 25).

 [23] According to the account in
Genesis 3 to which Ben Sirach refers, sin, the cause of death, originated in
woman: Eve, the first human being to sin, induced Adam to follow her example.
But it is through Adam, as head of the race, that original sin and its
punishment of spiritual death are presented by St. Paul (Romans 5) as having
entered the world, to become the occasion for the redemptive work of Christ our
Lord.
