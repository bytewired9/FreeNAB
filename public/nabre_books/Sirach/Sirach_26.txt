[1]
 Happy the husband of a good wife,
twice-lengthened are his days; 
2
[2]
 A worthy wife brings joy to her husband,
peaceful and full is his life. 
3
A good wife is a generous gift bestowed upon
him who fears the LORD; 
4
Be he rich or poor, his heart is content, and a
smile is ever on his face. 
5
There are three things at which my heart quakes,
a fourth before which I quail: Though false charges in public, trial before all
the people, and lying testimony are harder to bear than death, 
6
[3]
 A jealous wife is heartache and mourning and a
scourging tongue like the other three. 
7
A bad wife is a chafing yoke; he who marries
her seizes a scorpion. 
8
A drunken wife arouses great anger, for she
does not hide her shame. 
9
By her eyelids and her haughty stare an
unchaste wife can be recognized. 
10
Keep a strict watch over an unruly wife, lest,
finding an opportunity, she make use of it; 
11
Follow close if her eyes are bold, and be not
surprised if she betrays you: 
12
As a thirsty traveler with eager mouth drinks
from any water that he finds, So she settles down before every tent peg and
opens her quiver for every arrow. 
13
A gracious wife delights her husband, her
thoughtfulness puts flesh on his bones; 
14
A gift from the LORD is her governed speech,
and her firm virtue is of surpassing worth. 
15
Choicest of blessings is a modest wife,
priceless her chaste person. 
16
Like the sun rising in the LORD'S heavens, the
beauty of a virtuous wife is the radiance of her home. 
17
[4]
 Like the light which shines above the holy
lampstand, are her beauty of face and graceful figure. 
18
[5]
 Golden columns on silver bases are her shapely
limbs and steady feet. 
19
These two bring grief to my heart, and the
third arouses my horror: A wealthy man reduced to want; illustrious men held in
contempt; And the man who passes from justice to sin, for whom the LORD makes
ready the sword. 
20
[6]
 A merchant can hardly remain upright, nor a
shopkeeper free from sin; 
1
 [1-4, 13-18] A good wife is as a
gift from God, bringing joy and peace, happiness and contentment to her husband
(
⇒
 Sirach 26:1-4) through her thoughtfulness,
reserve, modesty and chastity, beauty, grace and virtue
(
⇒
 Sirach 26:13-18). 
2
 [2] Worthy: gifted spiritually,
mentally and physically. Cf
⇒
 Proverb 31:10.
3
 [6-12] A repetition of the thought
expressed in 
⇒
 25:12-25.
4
 [17-18] The holy lampstand and the
golden columns stood in the holy place of the ancient Tabernacle
(
⇒
 Exodus 25:31-40;
⇒
 26:32).

 [18] Among the additions found here
in some manuscripts are the following lines: "My son, take care in the
prime of life not to surrender your strength to strangers; Single out from the
land a goodly field and there with confidence sow the seed of your increase; So
shall you have your offspring around you, and in confidence shall they grow up.
"Through
a woman for hire be thought of as a trifle, a married woman is a deadly snare
for those who embrace her. [Cf 
⇒
 Proverb 6:26]
"A wife's complaint should be made in meekness, and show itself in a
slight flush; But a loud-mouthed, scolding wife is a trumpet signaling for
battle: Any human being who answers that challenge will spend his life amid the
turbulence of war."

[

 26:20-
⇒
 27:15] From
proper conduct in family life, the author proceeds to social morality, warning
especially against injustice in commerce (
⇒
26:20-
⇒
 27:3), and perversity of speech in
business (
⇒
 Sirach 26:4-7). The pursuit of justice
in these matters is all the more meritorious as it is difficult
(
⇒
 Sirach 26:8-10). The discourses of the devout are
marked with wisdom, but the conversations of the wicked, with offense,
swearing, cursing, quarrels and even bloodshed (
⇒
26:11-15).
