[1]
 Say nothing harmful, small or great; be not a
foe instead of a friend; A bad name and disgrace will you acquire: "That
for the evil man with double tongue!" 
2
Fall not into the grip of desire, lest, like
fire, it consume your strength; 
3
Your leaves it will eat, your fruits destroy,
and you will be left a dry tree, 
4
For contumacious desire destroys its owner and
makes him the sport of his enemies. 
5
[2]
 A kind mouth multiplies friends, and gracious
lips prompt friendly greetings. 
6
Let your acquaintances be many, but one in a thousand
your confidant. 
7
When you gain a friend, first test him, and be
not too ready to trust him 
8
For one sort of friend is a friend when it
suits him, but he will not be with you in time of distress. 
9
Another is a friend who becomes an enemy, and
tells of the quarrel to your shame. 
10
Another is a friend, a boon companion, who will
not be with you when sorrow comes. 
11
When things go well, he is your other self, and
lords it over your servants; 
12
But if you are brought low, he turns against
you and avoids meeting you. 
13
Keep away from your enemies; be on your guard
with your friends. 
14
A faithful friend is a sturdy shelter; he who
finds one finds a treasure. 
15
A faithful friend is beyond price, no sum can
balance his worth. 
16
A faithful friend is a life-saving remedy, such
as he who fears God finds; 
17
For he who fears God behaves accordingly, and
his friend will be like himself.

[3]
 My son, from your youth embrace discipline;
thus will you find wisdom with graying hair. 
19
As though plowing and sowing, draw close to
her; then await her bountiful crops. 
20
For in cultivating her you will labor but
little, and soon you will eat of her fruits. 
21
How irksome she is to the unruly! The fool
cannot abide her. 
22
She will be like a burdensome stone to test
him, and he will not delay in casting her aside. 
23
[4]
 For discipline is like her name, she is not
accessible to many. 
24
Listen, my son, and heed my advice; refuse not
my counsel. 
25
Put your feet into her fetters, and your neck
under her yoke. 
26
Stoop your shoulders and carry her and be not
irked at her bonds. 
27
With all your soul draw close to her; with all
your strength keep her ways. 
28
Search her out, discover her; seek her and you
will find her. Then when you have her, do not let her go; 
29
Thus will you afterward find rest in her, and
she will become your joy. 
30
Her fetters will be your throne of majesty; her
bonds, your purple cord. 
31
[5]
 You will wear her as your robe of glory, bear
her as your splendid crown. 
32
My son, if you wish, you can be taught; if you
apply yourself, you will be shrewd. 
33
If you are willing to listen, you will learn;
if you give heed, you will be wise. 
34
Frequent the company of the elders; whoever is wise,
stay close to him. 
35
Be eager to hear every godly discourse; let no
wise saying escape you. 
36
If you see a man of prudence, seek him out; let
your feet wear away his doorstep! 
37
Reflect on the precepts of the LORD, let his
commandments be your constant meditation; Then he will enlighten your mind, and
the wisdom you desire he will grant.

tongue!": people will say this against the man whose deceitful tongue has
brought him to disgrace.

 [5-17] True friends are discerned
not by prosperity (
⇒
 Sirach 6:11), but through the trials
of adversity: distress, quarrels (
⇒
 Sirach 6:9),
sorrow (
⇒
 Sirach 6:10) and misfortune
(
⇒
 Sirach 6:12). Such friends are rare and their
value is beyond estimation, a gift from God (
⇒
6:14-17).
3
 [18-37] The various figures in each
of the three strophes urge the search for wisdom through patience
(
⇒
 Sirach 6:19-23), docility
(
⇒
 Sirach 6:32-37), and perseverance in trials
(
⇒
 Sirach 6:25-27), promising rich rewards
(
⇒
 Sirach 6:28-31). Cf 
⇒
4:11-19.

 [23] Discipline (musar, in the sense
of wisdom) is a perfect homonym for musar, "removed, withdrawn"; thus
the path of discipline is inaccessible to many.
5
 [31] Some forms of the text speak
also of the "yoke" of wisdom under the imagery of golden ornaments.
