[1]
 LORD, Father and Master of my life, permit me
not to fall by them! 
2
Who will apply the lash to my thoughts, to my
mind the rod of discipline, That my failings may not be spared, nor the sins of
my heart overlooked; 
3
Lest my failings increase, and my sins be
multiplied; Lest I succumb to my foes, and my enemy rejoice over me? 
4
LORD, Father and God of my life, abandon me not
into their control! 
5
A brazen look allow me not; ward off passion
from my heart, 
6
Let not the lustful cravings of the flesh
master me, surrender me not to shameless desires. 
7
[2]
 Give heed, my children, to the instruction
that I pronounce, for he who keeps it will not be enslaved. 
8
Through his lips is the sinner ensnared; the
railer and the arrogant man fall thereby. 
9
Let not your mouth form the habit of swearing, or
becoming too familiar with the Holy Name. 
10
[3]
 Just as a slave that is constantly under
scrutiny will not be without welts, So one who swears continually by the Holy
Name will not remain free from sin. 
11
A man who often swears heaps up obligations;
the scourge will never be far from his house. If he swears in error, he incurs
guilt; if he neglects his obligation, his sin is doubly great. If he swears
without reason he cannot be found just, and all his house will suffer
affliction. 
12
There are words which merit death; may they
never be heard among Jacob's heirs. For all such words are foreign to the
devout, who do not wallow in sin. 
13
Let not your mouth become used to coarse talk,
for in it lies sinful matter. 
14
Keep your father and mother in mind when you
sit among the mighty, Lest in their presence you commit a blunder and disgrace
your upbringing, By wishing you had never been born or cursing the day of your
birth. 
15
A man who has the habit of abusive language
will never mature in character as long as he lives. 
16
[4]
[5]
 Two types of men multiply
sins, a third draws down wrath; For burning passion is a blazing fire, not to
be quenched till it burns itself out: A man given to sins of the flesh, who
never stops until the fire breaks forth; 
17
The rake to whom all bread is sweet and who is
never through till he dies; 
18
And the man who dishonors his marriage bed and
says to himself "Who can see me? Darkness surrounds me, walls hide me; no
one sees me; why should I fear to sin?" Of the Most High he is not
mindful, 
19
fearing only the eyes of men; He does not
understand that the eyes of the LORD, ten thousand times brighter than the sun,
Observe every step a man takes and peer into hidden corners. 
20
He who knows all things before they exist still
knows them all after they are made. 
21
[6]
 Such a man will be punished in the streets of
the city; when he least expects it, he will be apprehended. 
22
So also with the woman who is unfaithful to her
husband and offers as heir her son by a stranger. 
23
[7]
 First, she has disobeyed the law of the Most
High; secondly, she has wronged her husband; Thirdly, in her wanton adultery
she has borne children by another man. 
24
[8]
 Such a woman will be dragged before the
assembly, and her punishment will extend to her children; 
25
Her children will not take root; her branches
will not bring forth fruit. 
26
She will leave an accursed memory; her disgrace
will never be blotted out. 
27
Thus all who dwell on the earth shall know, and
all who inhabit the world shall understand, That nothing is better than the
fear of the LORD, nothing more salutary than to obey his commandments.

 [1] LORD, Father and Master of my
life: these words express the tender personal relationship between the author's
soul and God, the need of his assistance, and the truth of his providence. 
2
 [7-15] A warning against sins of
the tongue through misuse of the Holy Name, thoughtless swearing which involves
obligation and incurs guilt (
⇒
 Sirach 23:7-11),
blasphemy (
⇒
 Sirach 23:12), talk that is coarse and
blundersome (
⇒
 Sirach 23:13,
⇒
 14), and the incorrigible habit of abusive
language (
⇒
 Sirach 23:15).
3
 [10] As a slave . . . under
scrutiny, so is he who calls on God to witness the truth of what he says.
4
 [16-27] From sins of the tongue the
author proceeds to treat of sins of the flesh and their dire consequences. The
passion of lust tyrannizes over its victims and, like fire, consumes and
utterly destroys them (
⇒
 Sirach 23:16,
⇒
 17, 
⇒
 22-26). The
false security of the adulterer serves but to aggravate his inevitable fate
(
⇒
 Sirach 23:18-21). Only the fear of the Lord and
observance of his commandments can assure moral safety (
⇒
23:27).
5
 [16] Two types . . . a third: three
kinds of sins of impurity, with increasing degrees of gravity: solitary sins
(
⇒
 Sirach 23:16) fornication
(
⇒
 Sirach 23:17) and adultery
(
⇒
 Sirach 23:18-21).
6
 [21] Cf 
⇒
 Lev
20:19; 
⇒
 Deut 22:22.
7
 [23] The detailed evil of adultery
includes disobedience to God's law (
⇒
 Exodus
20:14), injustice to a partner in marriage, and disgraceful
offspring.
8
 [24-25] The judgment of the
assembly determined the illegitimacy of children born of adultery or incest and
excluded them from the "community of the LORD"
(
⇒
 Deut 23:3). Cf 
⇒
 Wisdom
3:16-19; 
⇒
 4:3-6.
