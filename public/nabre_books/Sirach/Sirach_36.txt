 Come to our aid, O God of the universe, and
put all the nations in dread of you! 
2
Raise your hand against the heathen, that they
may realize your power. 
3
As you have used us to show them your holiness,
so now use them to show us your glory. 
4
Thus they will know, as we know, that there is
no God but you. 
5
Give new signs and work new wonders; show forth
the splendor of your right hand and arm; 
6
Rouse your anger, pour out wrath, humble the
enemy, scatter the foe. 
7
Hasten the day, bring on the time; 
9
crush the heads of the hostile rulers. 
8
Let raging fire consume the fugitive, and your
people's oppressors meet destruction. 
10
Gather all the tribes of Jacob, that they may
inherit the land as of old, 
11
Show mercy to the people called by your name;
Israel, whom you named your first-born. 
12
Take pity on your holy city, Jerusalem, your
dwelling place. 
13
Fill Zion with your majesty, your temple with
your glory. 
14
Give evidence of your deeds of old; fulfill the
prophecies spoken in your name, 
15
Reward those who have hoped in you, and let
your prophets be proved true. 
16
Hear the prayer of your servants, for you are
ever gracious to your people; 
17
Thus it will be known to the very ends of the
earth that you are the eternal God.

[2]
 The throat can swallow any food, yet some
foods are more agreeable than others; 
19
As the palate tests meat by its savor, so does
a keen mind insincere words. 
20
A deceitful character causes grief, but an
experienced man can turn the tables on him. 
21
Though any man may be accepted as a husband,
yet one girl will be more suitable than another: 
22
A woman's beauty makes her husband's face light
up, for it surpasses all else that charms the eye; 
23
And if, besides, her speech is kindly, his lot
is beyond that of mortal men. 
24
A wife is her husband's richest treasure, a
helpmate, a steadying column. 
25
A vineyard with no hedge will be overrun; a man
with no wife becomes a homeless wanderer. 
26
Who will trust an armed band that shifts from
city to city? 
27
Or a man who has no nest, but lodges where
night overtakes him?

 [1-17] Making an act of faith and
hope in the supreme Lord of the universe, the author begs God to continue
manifesting his holiness and mercy through Israel, his people
(
⇒
 Sirach 36:1-3,
⇒
 10-13), and his power and justice through the
punishment of the nations (
⇒
 Sirach 36:2,
⇒
 5-9), that all the earth may acknowledge him the
eternal God (
⇒
 Sirach 36:4,
⇒
 14-17).

[
⇒
 36:18-
⇒
 37:15] In
the choice of wife, friend or associate, experience is a discerner of character
(
⇒
 Sirach 36:18-21). Beauty and kindly speech make
a woman desirable as wife (
⇒
 Sirach 36:22-24). The
good wife becomes her husband's richest treasure, his helpmate in establishing
his household (
⇒
 Sirach 36:24-27). A true friend
fights for his comrade and shares his spoils with him
(
⇒
 Sirach 37:5-6); a false one deceives and abandons
him in time of need (
⇒
 Sirach 37:1-4). A true
counselor and associate should be sought among those who keep the commandments,
not among those who break them and seek their own advantage
(
⇒
 Sirach 37:7-12). In all things pray to God for
light and follow conscience (
⇒
 Sirach 37:13-15).
