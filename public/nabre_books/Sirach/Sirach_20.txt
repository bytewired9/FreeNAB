[1]
 An admonition can be inopportune, and a man
may be wise to hold his peace. 
2
It is much better to admonish than to lose
one's temper, for one who admits his fault will be kept from disgrace. 
3
[2]
 Like a eunuch lusting for intimacy with a
maiden is he who does right under compulsion. 
4
One man is silent and is thought wise, another
is talkative and is disliked. 
5
One man is silent because he has nothing to
say; another is silent, biding his time. 
6
A wise man is silent till the right time comes,
but a boasting fool ignores the proper time. 
7
He who talks too much is detested; he who
pretends to authority is hated. 
8
[3]
 Some misfortunes bring success; some things
gained are a man's loss. 
9
[4]
 Some gifts do one no good, and some must be
paid back double. 
10
Humiliation can follow fame, while from
obscurity a man can lift up his head. 
11
A man may buy much for little, but pay for it
seven times over. 
12
A wise man makes himself popular by a few
words, but fools pour forth their blandishments in vain. 
13
A gift from a rogue will do you no good, for in
his eyes his one gift is equal to seven. 
14
He gives little and criticizes often, and like
a crier he shouts aloud. He lends today, he asks it back tomorrow; hateful
indeed is such a man. 
15
A fool has no friends, nor thanks for his
generosity; 
16
Those who eat his bread have an evil tongue.
How many times they laugh him to scorn! 
17
[5]
 A fall to the ground is less sudden than a
slip of the tongue; that is why the downfall of the wicked comes so quickly. 
18
Insipid food is the untimely tale; the unruly
are always ready to offer it. 
19
A proverb when spoken by a fool is unwelcome,
for he does not utter it at the proper time. 
20
A man through want may be unable to sin, yet in
this tranquility he cannot rest. 
21
One may lose his life through shame, and perish
through a fool's intimidation. 
22
A man makes a promise to a friend out of shame,
and has him for his enemy needlessly. 
23
A lie is a foul blot in a man, yet it is
constantly on the lips of the unruly. 
24
Better a thief than an inveterate liar, yet
both will suffer disgrace; 
25
A liar's way leads to dishonor, his shame
remains ever with him. 
26
[6]
 A wise man advances himself by his words, a
prudent man pleases the great. 
27
He who works his land has abundant crops, he
who pleases the great is pardoned his faults. 
28
Favors and gifts blind the eyes; like a muzzle
over the mouth they silence reproof. 
29
Hidden wisdom and unseen treasure -  of what value is either? 
30
Better the man who hides his folly than the one
who hides his wisdom. 
1
 [1-7] Wisdom indicates the proper
times for speech and silence, that is, the occasions when the most benefit can
be gained from them. 
2
 [3] The sense is that violence or
force against a person can prevent an external act of sin or compel a good deed
without eliminating the internal sin or desire of wrongdoing. Cf
⇒
 Sirach 20:20.
3
 [8-16] In a series of paradoxes the
author indicates how much true and lasting values differ from apparent ones.
4
 [9] And some . . . double: or
perhaps, "but some are doubly precious."
5
 [17-25] The ill-timed speech of the
wicked, the unruly and a fool is repulsive (
⇒
20:17-19); human respect exposes one to intimidation, rash promises
and enmity (
⇒
 Sirach 20:21- 22); lies bring
dishonor and lasting disgrace (
⇒
 Sirach 20:23,
⇒
 24, 
⇒
 25).
6
 [26-30] Unlike the fool who invites
disaster through misuse of his tongue, the sage through prudent speech gains in
honor and esteem among the great (
⇒
20:26-27). He must beware, however, of accepting bribes, lest he
share in evil through silence when he should reprove
(
⇒
 Sirach 20:28-30).
