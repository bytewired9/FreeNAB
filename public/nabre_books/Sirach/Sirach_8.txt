[1]
 Contend not with an influential man, lest you
fall into his power. 
2
Quarrel not with a rich man, lest he pay out
the price of your downfall; For gold has dazzled many, and perverts the
character of princes. 
3
Dispute not with a man of railing speech, heap
no wood upon his fire. 
4
Be not too familiar with an unruly man, lest he
speak ill of your forebears. 
5
[2]
 Shame not a repentant sinner; remember, we all
are guilty. 
6
Insult no man when he is old, for some of us,
too, will grow old. 
7
Rejoice not when a man dies; remember, we are
all to die. 
8
Spurn not the discourse of the wise, but
acquaint yourself with their proverbs; From them you will acquire the training
to serve in the presence of princes. 
9
Reject not the tradition of old men which they
have learned from their fathers; From it you will obtain the knowledge how to
answer in time of need. 
10
Kindle not the coals of a sinner, lest you be
consumed in his flaming fire. 
11
[3]
 Let not the impious man intimidate you; it
will set him in ambush against you. 
12
Lend not to one more powerful than yourself;
and whatever you lend, count it as lost. 
13
Go not surety beyond your means; think any pledge
a debt you must pay. 
14
Contend not at law with a judge, for he will
settle it according to his whim. 
15
Travel not with a ruthless man, lest he weigh
you down with calamity; For he will go his own way straight, and through his
folly you will perish with him. 
16
Provoke no quarrel with a quick-tempered man,
nor ride with him through the desert, For bloodshed is nothing to him; when
there is no one to help you, he will destroy you. 
17
Take no counsel with a fool, for he can keep
nothing to himself. 
18
Before a stranger do nothing that should be
kept secret, for you know not what it will engender. 
19
Open your heart to no man, and banish not your
happiness.

 [1-19] A prudent man will be
circumspect, avoiding conflict with the powerful, the rich and insolent, the
impious, the irascible, and with judges (

8:1-3, 
⇒
 10-12,

friendship not with the undisciplined (

 Sirach 8:4,

 12- 13) and the ruthless
(
⇒
 Sirach 8:15), nor with fools and strangers
(

 Sirach 8:17-19), but with the wise and the
ancients of the people (

 Sirach 8:8,

 [11] To give in to the wicked in
one instance becomes an occasion of sin for the future.
