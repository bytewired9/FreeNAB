[1]
 Keeping watch over riches wastes the flesh,
and the care of wealth drives away rest. 
2
[2]
 Concern for one's livelihood banishes slumber;
more than a serious illness it disturbs repose. 
3
The rich man labors to pile up wealth, and his
only rest is wanton pleasure; 
4
The poor man toils for a meager subsistence,
and if ever he rests, he finds himself in want. 
5
The lover of gold will not be free from sin,
for he who pursues wealth is led astray by it. 
6
Many have been ensnared by gold, though
destruction lay before their eyes; 
7
It is a stumbling block to those who are avid
for it, a snare for every fool. 
8
[3]
 Happy the rich man found without fault, who
turns not aside after gain! 
9
Who is he, that we may praise him? he, of all
his kindred, has done wonders, 
10
For he has been tested by gold and come off
safe, and this remains his glory; He could have sinned but did not, could have
done evil but would not, 
11
So that his possessions are secure, and the
assembly recounts his praises. 
12
[4]
 If you are dining with a great man, bring not
a greedy gullet to his table, Nor cry out, "How much food there is
here!" 
13
Remember that gluttony is evil. No creature is
greedier than the eye: therefore it weeps for any cause. 
15
Recognize that your neighbor feels as you do,
and keep in mind your own dislikes: 
14
Toward what he eyes, do not put out a hand; nor
reach when he does for the same dish. 
16
Behave at table like a favored guest, and be
not greedy, lest you be despised. 
17
Be the first to stop, as befits good manners;
gorge not yourself, lest you give offense. 
18
If there are many with you at table, be not the
first to reach out your hand. 
19
Does not a little suffice for a well-bred man?
When he lies down, it is without discomfort. 
20
Distress and anguish and loss of sleep, and
restless tossing for the glutton! Moderate eating ensures sound slumber and a
clear mind next day on rising. 
21
[5]
 If perforce you have eaten too much, once you
have emptied your stomach, you will have relief. 
22
Listen to me, my son, and scorn me not; later
you will find my advice good. In whatever you do, be moderate, and no sickness
will befall you. 
23
On a man generous with food, blessings are invoked,
and this testimony to his goodness is lasting; 
24
He who is miserly with food is denounced in
public, and this testimony to his stinginess is lasting. 
25
Let not wine-drinking be the proof of your
strength, for wine has been the ruin of many. 
26
As the furnace probes the work of the smith, so
does wine the hearts of the insolent. 
27
Wine is very life to man if taken in
moderation. Does he really live who lacks the wine which was created for his
joy? 
28
Joy of heart, good cheer and merriment are wine
drunk freely at the proper time. 
29
Headache, bitterness and disgrace is wine drunk
amid anger and strife. 
30
More and more wine is a snare for the fool; it
lessens his strength and multiplies his wounds. 
31
Rebuke not your neighbor when wine is served,
nor put him to shame while he is merry; Use no harsh words with him and
distress him not in the presence of others.

 [1-11] Solicitude for acquiring
wealth and anxiety over preserving it disturb repose and easily lead to sin and
ruin (
⇒
 Sirach 31:1-7). Cf
⇒
 Matthew 6:25-34. A rich man who has not sinned or
been seduced by wealth is worthy of praise (
⇒
31:8-11).

 [2] The Hebrew adds a verse that
seems out of place here: "A faithful comrade drives away reproach, and the
friend who keeps secrets is as dear as life."

 [8-10] The Church in her liturgy
applies this passage to holy confessors of the Faith.

practice of induced vomiting, well-known among pagan Romans, and less
well-known among the Jews, seems to be referred to here.
