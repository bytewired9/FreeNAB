 The name JOSIAH is like blended incense, made
lasting by a skilled perfumer. Precious is his memory, like honey to the taste,
like music at a banquet. 
2
For he grieved over our betrayals, and
destroyed the abominable idols. 
3
He turned to God with his whole heart, and,
though times were evil, he practiced virtue. 
4
Except for David, Hezekiah and Josiah, they all
were wicked; They abandoned the Law of the Most High, these kings of Judah,
right to the very end. 
5
So he gave over their power to others, their
glory to a foolish foreign nation 
6
Who burned the holy city and left its streets
desolate, As JEREMIAH had foretold; 
7
for they had treated him badly who even in the
womb had been made a prophet, To root out, pull down, and destroy, and then to
build and to plant. 
8
EZEKIEL beheld the vision and described the
different creatures of the chariot; 
9
He also referred to JOB, who always persevered
in the right path. 
10
Then, too, the TWELVE PROPHETS -  may their bones return to life from their
resting place! -  Gave new strength to
Jacob and saved him by their faith and hope.

 How can we fittingly praise ZERUBBABEL, who
was like a signet ring on God's right hand, 
12
And Jeshua, Jozadak's son? In their time they
built the house of God; They erected the holy temple, destined for everlasting
glory. 
13
Extolled be the memory of NEHEMIAH! He rebuilt
our ruined walls, Restored our shattered defenses, and set up gates and bars. 
14
[3]
 Few on earth have been made the equal of
ENOCH, for he was taken up bodily. 
15
Was ever a man born like JOSEPH? Even his dead
body was provided for. 
16
Glorious, too, were SHEM and SETH and ENOS; but
beyond that of any living being was the splendor of ADAM.

 [1-10] The author's praise of King
Josiah (
⇒
 Sirach 49:1-3), of the prophets Jeremiah
and Ezekiel and likewise the minor prophets (
⇒
49:7-10) derives from their spirit of fidelity to the Lord and his
law amid the infidelity of kings and people (
⇒
49:4-6, 
⇒
 10).

 [11-13] Zerubbabel and Jeshua, in
rebuilding the temple, and Nehemiah, the governor, in repairing the walls of
the Holy City also restored what these constructions signify, namely, religious
worship and civil authority as prescribed in the law.
3
 [14-16] The patriarchs here
mentioned were glorious because of their spirit of religion, i.e., their
profound reverence for God and obedience to him. The splendor of Adam,
moreover, was due to his direct origin from God.
