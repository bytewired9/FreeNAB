1
The vengeful will suffer the LORD'S vengeance,
for he remembers their sins in detail. 
2
Forgive your neighbor's injustice; then when
you pray, your own sins will be forgiven. 
3
Should a man nourish anger against his fellows
and expect healing from the LORD? 
4
Should a man refuse mercy to his fellows, yet
seek pardon for his own sins? 
5
If he who is but flesh cherishes wrath, who
will forgive his sins? 
6
Remember your last days, set enmity aside;
remember death and decay, and cease from sin! 
7
Think of the commandments, hate not your
neighbor; of the Most High's covenant, and overlook faults. 
8
Avoid strife and your sins will be fewer, for a
quarrelsome man kindles disputes, 
9
Commits the sin of disrupting friendship and
sows discord among those at peace. 
10
The more wood, the greater the fire, the more
underlying it, the fiercer the fight; The greater a man's strength, the sterner
his anger, the greater his power, the greater his wrath. 
11
Pitch and resin make fires flare up, and
insistent quarrels provoke bloodshed. 
12
[1]
 If you blow upon a spark, it quickens into
flame, if you spit on it, it dies out; yet both you do with your mouth! 
13
Cursed be gossips and the double-tongued, for
they destroy the peace of many. 
14
A meddlesome tongue subverts many, and makes
them refugees among the peoples; It destroys walled cities, and overthrows
powerful dynasties. 
15
A meddlesome tongue can drive virtuous women
from their homes and rob them of the fruit of their toil; 
16
Whoever heeds it has no rest, nor can he dwell
in peace. 
17
A blow from a whip raises a welt, but a blow
from the tongue smashes bones; 
18
Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but
not as many as by the tongue. 
19
Happy he who is sheltered from it, and has not
endured its wrath; Who has not borne its yoke nor been fettered with its chain;
20
For its yoke is a yoke of iron and its chains
are chains of bronze! 
21
Dire is the death it inflicts, besides which
even the nether world is a gain; 
22
It will not take hold among the just nor scorch
them in its flame, 
23
But those who forsake the LORD will fall
victims to it, as it burns among them unquenchably! It will hurl itself against
them like a lion; like a panther, it will tear them to pieces. 
24
As you hedge round your vineyard with thorns,
set barred doors over your mouth; 
25
As you seal up your silver and gold, so balance
and weigh your words. 
26
Take care not to slip by your tongue and fall
victim to your foe waiting in ambush.

domestic peace (

 Sirach 28:12-16). The whip, the
sword, chains, even the nether world, are not so cruel as the suffering
inflicted by an evil tongue (

 Sirach 28:17-21).
Not the just but those who forsake the LORD are victims of their evil tongues
(

 Sirach 28:22,

 23).
Therefore, guard your mouth and tongue as you would guard treasure against an
enemy (

 Sirach 28:24-26).
