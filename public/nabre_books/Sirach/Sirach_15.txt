1
He who fears the LORD will do this; he who is
practiced in the law will come to wisdom. 
2
Motherlike she will meet him, like a young
bride she will embrace him, 
3
Nourish him with the bread of understanding,
and give him the water of learning to drink. 
4
He will lean upon her and not fall, he will
trust in her and not be put to shame. 
5
She will exalt him above his fellows; in the
assembly she will make him eloquent. 
6
Joy and gladness he will find, an everlasting
name inherit. 
7
Worthless men will not attain to her, haughty
men will not behold her. 
8
Far from the impious is she, not to be spoken
of by liars. 
9
Unseemly is praise on a sinner's lips, for it is
not accorded to him by God. 
10
But praise is offered by the wise man's tongue;
its rightful steward will proclaim it. 
11
Say not: "It was God's doing that I fell
away"; for what he hates he does not do. 
12
Say not: "It was he who set me
astray"; for he has no need of wicked man. 
13
Abominable wickedness the LORD hates, he does
not let it befall those who fear him. 
14
When God, in the beginning, created man, he made
him subject to his own free choice. 
15
If you choose you can keep the commandments; it
is loyalty to do his will. 
16
There are set before you fire and water; to
whichever you choose, stretch forth your hand. 
17
Before man are life and death, whichever he
chooses shall be given him. 
18
Immense is the wisdom of the LORD; he is mighty
in power, and all-seeing. 
19
The eyes of God see all he has made; he
understands man's every deed. 
20
No man does he command to sin, to none does he
give strength for lies.
