[1]
 After him came NATHAN who served in the
presence of David. 
2
Like the choice fat of the sacred offerings, so
was DAVID in Israel. 
3
He made sport of lions as though they were
kids, and of bears, like lambs of the flock. 
4
As a youth he slew the giant and wiped out the
people's disgrace, When his hand let fly the slingstone that crushed the pride
of Goliath. 
5
Since he called upon the Most High God, who
gave strength to his right arm To defeat the skilled warrior and raise up the
might of his people, 
6
Therefore the women sang his praises and
ascribed to him tens of thousands. When he assumed the royal crown, he battled 
7
and subdued the enemy on every side. He
destroyed the hostile Philistines and shattered their power till our own day. 
8
With his every deed he offered thanks to God
Most High, in words of praise. With his whole being he loved his Maker and
daily had his praises sung; 
9
He added beauty to the feasts and solemnized
the seasons of each year With string music before the altar, providing sweet
melody for the psalms 
10
So that when the Holy Name was praised, before
daybreak the sanctuary would resound. 
11
The LORD forgave him his sins and exalted his
strength forever; He conferred on him the rights of royalty and established his
throne in Israel. 
12
[2]
 Because of his merits he had as his successor
a wise son, who lived in security: 
13
SOLOMON reigned during an era of peace, for God
made tranquil all his borders. He built a house to the name of God, and
established a lasting sanctuary. 
14
How wise you were when you were young,
overflowing with instruction, like the Nile in flood! 
15
Your understanding covered the whole earth,
and, like a sea, filled it with knowledge. 
16
Your fame reached distant coasts, and their
peoples came to hear you; 
17
With song and story and riddle, and with your
answers, you astounded the nations. 
18
[3]
 You were called by that glorious name which
was conferred upon Israel. Gold you gathered like so much iron, you heaped up
silver as though it were lead; 
19
But you abandoned yourself to women and gave
them dominion over your body. 
20
You brought dishonor upon your reputation,
shame upon your marriage, Wrath upon your descendants, and groaning upon your
domain; 
21
Thus two governments came into being, when in
Ephraim kingship was usurped. 
22
But God does not withdraw his mercy, nor permit
even one of his promises to fail. He does not uproot the posterity of his
chosen one, nor destroy the offspring of his friend. So he gave to Jacob a
remnant, to David a root from his own family. 
23
[4]
 Solomon finally slept with his fathers, and
left behind him one of his sons, Expansive in folly, limited in sense,
REHOBOAM, who by his policy made the people rebel; Until one arose who should
not be remembered, the sinner who led Israel into sin, Who brought ruin to
Ephraim 
24
and caused them to be exiled from their land.
Their sinfulness grew more and more, 
25
[5]
 and they lent themselves to every evil, 
1
 [1-11] David, a youthful and
fearless warrior, the favorite of all Israel, by defeating Goliath, the
boastful Philistine giant, removed the people's disgrace and greatly
strengthened their power (
⇒
 Sirach 47:1-7). With his
whole being he loved and praised God, and his devotion to divine worship led
him to develop a liturgical cult. David fell into sin, but repenting, received
pardon from God and the promise of an everlasting kingdom
(
⇒
 Sirach 47:8-11). 
2
 [12-24] Solomon, son and successor
of David, inherited peace through his father's conquests. He built the
magnificent temple of Jerusalem (
⇒
 Sirach 47:12-13)
and received from God the favor of unparalleled wisdom, through which he
obtained great fame (
⇒
 Sirach 47:14-17). Luxury and
sensuality, however, brought disgrace upon him, and because of his oppressive
burdens, he disposed the kingdom for division after his death
(
⇒
 Sirach 47:19-21,
⇒
 23-24). Nevertheless God did not withdraw his
promise of establishing his throne in the descendants of David
(
⇒
 Sirach 47:22).
3
 [18] Cf 
⇒
 2 Sam
12:25 where Solomon is called Jedidiah, "beloved of the
Lord." The same term is used of Israel in 
⇒
 Jeremiah
11:15.
4
 [23] Expansive: the name Rehoboam
means "the people is expansive," that is, widespread. The sinner:
Jeroboam; cf 
⇒
 1 Kings 12:2,
⇒
 20, 
⇒
 26-32.
5
[
⇒
 47:25-
⇒
 48:11] The
prophetic ministry of Elijah amid widespread idolatry is here described as a
judgment by fire (
⇒
 Sirach 47:25-26). Through his
preaching, miracles and vengeance against God's enemies within and without
Israel, the prophet succeeded for a time in destroying idols and in restoring
faith and the worship of the true God (
⇒
48:2-8). His miraculous departure from this life gave rise to the
belief that he did not die but would return before the end of the world to put
an end to wrath and restore the tribes of Israel (
⇒
48:9-11). Cf 
⇒
 Matthew 17:9-13.
