[1]
 Children, pay heed to a father's right; do so
that you may live. 
2
For the LORD sets a father in honor over his
children; a mother's authority he confirms over her sons. 
3
He who honors his father atones for sins; 
4
he stores up riches who reveres his mother. 
5
He who honors his father is gladdened by
children, and when he prays he is heard. 
6
He who reveres his father will live a long
life; he obeys the LORD who brings comfort to his mother. 
7
He who fears the LORD honors his father, and
serves his parents as rulers. 
8
In word and deed honor your father that his
blessing may come upon you; 
9
For a father's blessing gives a family firm
roots, but a mother's curse uproots the growing plant. 
10
Glory not in your father's shame, for his shame
is no glory to you! 
11
His father's honor is a man's glory; disgrace
for her children, a mother's shame. 
12
My son, take care of your father when he is
old; grieve him not as long as he lives. 
13
Even if his mind fail, be considerate with him;
revile him not in the fullness of your strength. 
14
For kindness to a father will not be forgotten,
it will serve as a sin offering - it will take lasting root. 
15
In time of tribulation it will be recalled to
your advantage, like warmth upon frost it will melt away your sins. 
16
A blasphemer is he who despises his father;
accursed of his Creator, he who angers his mother. 
17
[2]
 My son, conduct your affairs with humility,
and you will be loved more than a giver of gifts. 
18
Humble yourself the more, the greater you are,
and you will find favor with God. 
19
[3]
 For great is the power of God; by the humble
he is glorified. 
20
What is too sublime for you, seek not, into
things beyond your strength search not. 
21
What is committed to you, attend to; for what
is hidden is not your concern. 
22
With what is too much for you meddle not, when
shown things beyond human understanding. 
23
Their own opinion has misled many, and false
reasoning unbalanced their judgment. 
24
Where the pupil of the eye is missing, there is
no light, and where there is no knowledge, there is no wisdom. 
25
A stubborn man will fare badly in the end, and
he who loves danger will perish in it. 
26
A stubborn man will be burdened with sorrow; a
sinner will heap sin upon sin. 
27
For the affliction of the proud man there is no
cure; he is the offshoot of an evil plant. 
28
The mind of a sage appreciates proverbs, and an
attentive ear is the wise man's joy. 
29
[4]
 Water quenches a flaming fire, and alms atone
for sins. 
30
He who does a kindness is remembered afterward;
when he falls, he finds a support.

 [1-16] Besides the virtues that
must characterize our conduct toward God, special duties toward our neighbor
are enjoined, such as honor and respect toward parents, with corresponding
blessings (
⇒
 Sirach 3:1-9). Even to old and infirm
parents this respect is due (
⇒
 Sirach 3:10-13);
through it, the sins of children are pardoned (
⇒
3:14, 
⇒
 15). Failure to render respect is
blasphemy and merits a curse from God (
⇒
 Sirach 3:16).
Cf 
⇒
 Exodus 20:12; 
⇒
 Eph
6:2-3. 
2
 [17-27] Humility gives a true
estimate of self (
⇒
 Sirach 3:17-19). Through it a
man performs duty, avoids what is beyond his understanding and strength
(
⇒
 Sirach 3:20-22). Pride, however, begets false
greatness, misjudgment, stubborness, sorrow, affliction and perdition
(
⇒
 Sirach 3:23-27).

 [19] An alternate or additional
line would read: "For though many have been great in the course of time,
it is to the humble he reveals his secrets." Cf
⇒
 Matthew 11:25-26; 
⇒
 1 Cor
1:26-29.

 [29-
⇒
 4:10]
Mercy and kindness toward those in misfortune atone for sin and endear a man to
God and to his fellow men.
