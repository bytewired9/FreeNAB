[1]
 If you do good, know for whom you are doing
it, and your kindness will have its effect. 
2
Do good to the just man and reward will be
yours, if not from him, from the LORD. 
3
[2]
 No good comes to him who gives comfort to the
wicked, nor is it an act of mercy that he does. 
4
Give to the good man, refuse the sinner;
refresh the downtrodden, give nothing to the proud man. 
5
No arms for combat should you give him, lest he
use them against yourself; 
6
With twofold evil you will meet for every good
deed you do for him. 
7
The Most High himself hates sinners, and upon
the wicked he takes vengeance. 
8
[3]
 In our prosperity we cannot know our friends;
in adversity an enemy will not remain concealed. 
9
When a man is successful even his enemy is
friendly; in adversity even his friend disappears. 
10
Never trust your enemy, for his wickedness is
like corrosion in bronze. 
11
[4]
 Even though he acts humbly and peaceably
toward you, take care to be on your guard against him. Rub him as one polishes
a brazen mirror, and you will find that there is still corrosion. 
12
Let him not stand near you, lest he oust you
and take your place. Let him not sit at your right hand, lest he then demand
your seat, And in the end you appreciate my advice, when you groan with regret,
as I warned you. 
13
Who pities a snake charmer when he is bitten,
or anyone who goes near a wild beast? 
14
So is it with the companion of the proud man,
who is involved in his sins: 
15
While you stand firm, he makes no bold move;
but if you slip, he cannot hold back. 
16
With his lips an enemy speaks sweetly, but in
his heart he schemes to plunge you into the abyss. Though your enemy has tears
in his eyes, if given the chance, he will never have enough of your blood. 
17
If evil comes upon you, you will find him at
hand; feigning to help, he will trip you up, 
18
Then he will nod his head and clap his hands
and hiss repeatedly, and show his true face.

 [1-7] The limitations to the
practice of charity here reflected were removed by Christ, who requires that
good be done even to enemies and to those who hate, persecute and calumniate us
(

 Matthew 5:43-48). 
2
 [3-5] The author advises against
generosity to those who would abuse it.

 [8-18] Through adversity friends
are distinguished from enemies; to trust the latter or permit them intimacy is
to invite disaster. Cf note on
