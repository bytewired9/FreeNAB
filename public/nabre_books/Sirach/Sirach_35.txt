[1]
 To keep the law is a great oblation, and he
who observes the commandments sacrifices a peace offering. 
2
[2]
 In works of charity one offers fine flour, and
when he gives alms he presents his sacrifice of praise. 
3
To refrain from evil pleases the LORD, and to
avoid injustice is an atonement. 
4
Appear not before the LORD empty-handed, for
all that you offer is in fulfillment of the precepts. 
5
The just man's offering enriches the altar and
rises as a sweet odor before the Most High. 
6
The just man's sacrifice is most pleasing, nor
will it ever be forgotten. 
7
In generous spirit pay homage to the LORD, be
not sparing of freewill gifts. 
8
With each contribution show a cheerful
countenance, and pay your tithes in a spirit of joy. 
9
Give to the Most High as he has given to you,
generously, according to your means. 
10
For the LORD is one who always repays, and he
will give back to you sevenfold. 
11
But offer no bribes, these he does not accept!
Trust not in sacrifice of the fruits of extortion, 
12
For he is a God of justice, who knows no
favorites. 
13
[3]
 Though not unduly partial toward the weak, yet
he hears the cry of the oppressed. 
14
He is not deaf to the wail of the orphan, nor
to the widow when she pours out her complaint; 
15
Do not the tears that stream down her cheek cry
out against him that causes them to fall? 
16
He who serves God willingly is heard; his
petition reaches the heavens. 
17
The prayer of the lowly pierces the clouds; it
does not rest till it reaches its goal, 
18
Nor will it withdraw till the Most High
responds, judges justly and affirms the right. 
19
God indeed will not delay, and like a warrior,
will not be still 
20
Till he breaks the backs of the merciless and
wreaks vengeance upon the proud; 
21
Till he destroys the haughty root and branch,
and smashes the scepter of the wicked; 
22
Till he requites mankind according to its
deeds, and repays men according to their thoughts; 
23
Till he defends the cause of his people, and
gladdens them by his mercy. 
24
Welcome is his mercy in time of distress as
rain clouds in time of drought.

 [1-24] Keeping the commandments of
the law and avoiding injustice constitute sacrifice pleasing and acceptable to
God (
⇒
 Sirach 35:1-3). Offerings also should be made
to him, cheerfully and generously; these he repays . . . sevenfold
(
⇒
 Sirach 35:4-10). Extortion from widows and
orphans is injustice, which God quickly repays (
⇒
35:11-18). Punishing the proud and the merciless and coming to the
aid of the distressed, he requites all according to their deeds
(
⇒
 Sirach 35:19-24).

and frankincense, was a prescribed offering to God; cf
