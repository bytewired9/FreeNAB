1
A wise magistrate lends stability to his
people, and the government of a prudent man is well ordered. 
2
As the people's judge, so are his ministers; as
the head of a city, its inhabitants. 
3
A wanton king destroys his people, but a city
grows through the wisdom of its princes. 
4
Sovereignty over the earth is in the hand of
God, who raises up on it the man of the hour; 
5
Sovereignty over every man is in the hand of
God, who imparts his majesty to the ruler. 
6
[1]
 No matter the wrong, do no violence to your
neighbor, and do not walk the path of arrogance. 
7
Odious to the LORD and to men is arrogance, and
the sin of oppression they both hate. 
8
Dominion is transferred from one people to
another because of the violence of the arrogant. 
9
[2]
 Why are dust and ashes proud? even during life
man's body decays; 
10
A slight illness - the doctor jests, a king
today - tomorrow he is dead. 
11
When a man dies, he inherits corruption; worms
and gnats and maggots. 
12
The beginning of pride is man's stubbornness in
withdrawing his heart from his Maker; 
13
For pride is the reservoir of sin, a source
which runs over with vice; Because of it God sends unheard-of afflictions and
brings men to utter ruin. 
14
The thrones of the arrogant God overturns and
establishes the lowly in their stead. 
15
The roots of the proud God plucks up, to plant
the humble in their place: 
16
He breaks down their stem to the level of the
ground, then digs their roots from the earth. 
17
The traces of the proud God sweeps away and
effaces the memory of them from the earth. 
18
Insolence is not allotted to a man, nor
stubborn anger to one born of woman. 
19
[3]
 Whose offspring can be in honor? Those of men.
Which offspring are in honor? Those who fear God. Whose offspring can be in
disgrace? Those of men. Which offspring are in disgrace? Those who transgress
the commandments. 
20
Among brethren their leader is in honor; he who
fears God is in honor among his people. 
21
Be it tenant or wayfarer, alien or pauper, his
glory is the fear of the LORD. 
22
It is not just to despise a man who is wise but
poor, nor proper to honor any sinner. 
23
The prince, the ruler, the judge are in honor;
but none is greater than he who fears God. 
24
When free men serve a prudent slave, the wise
man does not complain. 
25
Flaunt not your wisdom in managing your affairs,
and boast not in your time of need. 
26
Better the worker who has plenty of everything
than the boaster who is without bread. 
27
My son, with humility have self-esteem; prize
yourself as you deserve. 
28
Who will acquit him who condemns himself? who
will honor him who discredits himself? 
29
The poor man is honored for his wisdom as the
rich man is honored for his wealth; 
30
Honored in poverty, how much more so in wealth!
Dishonored in wealth, in poverty how much the more!

 [6-18] Glory displayed through
arrogance and pride is false and displeasing to God and men, because founded on
dust and ashes (
⇒
 Sirach 10:6-11). It is the denial
of the glory due to God, and therefore the source of all sin
(
⇒
 Sirach 10:12-13). Even the memory of the proud
is destroyed and God transfers their power to the lowly
(
⇒
 Sirach 10:14-18).

 [9-10] The text is uncertain. Its
general implication is that man deteriorates physically even while alive: a
slight illness today may be followed by death tomorrow. The uncertainty of life
leaves no room for pride.
3
[19-
⇒
 11:6] Regardless of social barriers, genuine
honor among men comes from fear of the Lord and a true estimate of self. The
Lord exalts the lowly and oppressed; transgressors of the commandments merit
dishonor and disgrace.
