[1]
 Do no evil, and evil will not overtake you; 
2
avoid wickedness, and it will turn aside from
you. 
3
Sow not in the furrows of injustice, lest you
harvest it sevenfold. 
4
Seek not from the LORD authority, nor from the
king a place of honor. 
5
Parade not your justice before the Lord, and
before the king flaunt not your wisdom. 
6
Seek not to become a judge if you have not
strength to root out crime, Or you will show favor to the ruler and mar your
integrity. 
7
Be guilty of no evil before the city's
populace, nor disgrace yourself before the assembly. 
8
Do not plot to repeat a sin; not even for one
will you go unpunished. 
9
Say not: "He will appreciate my many
gifts; the Most High will accept my offerings." 
10
Be not impatient in prayers, and neglect not
the giving of alms. 
11
[2]
 Laugh not at an embittered man; be mindful of
him who exalts and humbles. 
12
Plot no mischief against your brother, nor
against your friend and companion. 
13
Delight not in telling lie after lie, for it
never results in good. 
14
[3]
 Thrust not yourself into the deliberations of
princes, and repeat not the words of your prayer. 
15
Hate not laborious tasks, nor farming, which
was ordained by the Most High. 
16
Do not esteem yourself better than your
fellows; remember, his wrath will not delay. 
17
More and more, humble your pride; what awaits
man is worms. 
18
[4]
[5]
 Barter not a friend for
money, nor a dear brother for the gold of Ophir. 
19
Dismiss not a sensible wife; a gracious wife is
more precious than corals. 
20
Mistreat not a servant who faithfully serves,
nor a laborer who devotes himself to his task. 
21
[6]
 Let a wise servant be dear to you as your own self;
refuse him not his freedom. 
22
If you have livestock, look after them; if they
are dependable, keep them. 
23
[7]
 If you have sons, chastise them; bend their
necks from childhood. 
24
If you have daughters, keep them chaste, and be
not indulgent to them. 
25
Giving your daughter in marriage ends a great
task; but give her to a worthy man. 
26
If you have a wife, let her not seem odious to
you; but where there is ill-feeling, trust her not. 
27
With your whole heart honor your father; your
mother's birthpangs forget not. 
28
Remember, of these parents you were born; what
can you give them for all they gave you? 
29
With all your soul, fear God, revere his
priests. 
30
With all your strength, love your Creator,
forsake not his ministers. 
31
[8]
 Honor God and respect the priest; give him his
portion as you have been commanded: First fruits and contributions, due
sacrifices and holy offerings. 
32
To the poor man also extend your hand, that
your blessing may be complete; 
33
[9]
 Be generous to all the living, and withhold
not your kindness from the dead. 
34
Avoid not those who weep, but mourn with those
who mourn; 
35
Neglect not to visit the sick -  for these things you will be loved. 
36
In whatever you do, remember your last days,
and you will never sin.

 [1-17] In the conduct of social
relations wisdom forbids evil and injustice (
⇒
7:1-3), pride (
⇒
 Sirach 7:5,
⇒
 15-17), ambition and human respect
(
⇒
 Sirach 7:4, 6), public
disorder (
⇒
 Sirach 7:7), presumption and impatience
toward God (
⇒
 Sirach 7:9-10), ridicule
(
⇒
 Sirach 7:11), mischief and deceit toward one's
neighbor (
⇒
 Sirach 7:8,
⇒
 12-13). 
2
 [11] Him who exalts and humbles:
God; cf 
⇒
 1 Sam 2:7; 
⇒
 Psalm
75:8; 
⇒
 Luke 1:52.
3
 [14] Repeat not . . . prayer:
brevity of speech in dealings with superiors and more especially with God is a
sign of reverence and respect; cf 
⇒
 Eccl 5:1;
⇒
 Matthew 6:7.
4
 [18-36] The duties of respect and
appreciation, justice and kindness should characterize relations toward members
of the household (
⇒
 Sirach 7:18-28), and also toward
God and his priests (
⇒
 Sirach 7:29-31), the poor and
afflicted, the living and the dead (
⇒
7:32-36).
5
 [18] Ophir was the port, at present
unidentified, to which the ships of Solomon sailed and from which they brought
back gold and silver; cf note on 
⇒
 Psalm 45:10.
6
 [21] After six years of service a
Hebrew slave was entitled to freedom, cf 
⇒
 Exodus
21:2; 
⇒
 Deut 15:12-15.
7
 [23] Bend their necks: keep them
from rebellious pride; so with the Greek. Cf 
⇒
30:12. The present Hebrew text, which is probably not original here,
reads: "Choose wives for them while they are young."
8
 [31] First fruits . . . holy
offerings: cf 
⇒
 Exodus 29:27;
⇒
 Lev 7:31-34; 
⇒
 Numbers
18:8-20; 
⇒
 Deut 18:1-5.
9
 [33] This seems to refer to the observances
ordained toward the dead, that is, proper mourning and burial. Cf
⇒
 2 Sam 21:12-14; 
⇒
 Tobit
1:20; 
⇒
 12:12. When this verse is read in
the light of later teaching, prayers for the souls of the deceased would also
be recommended. Cf 
⇒
 2 Macc 12:43-45.
