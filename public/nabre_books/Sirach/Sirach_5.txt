[1]
 Rely not on your wealth; say not: "I have
the power." 
2
Rely not on your strength in following the
desires of your heart. 
3
Say not: "Who can prevail against
me?" for the LORD will exact the punishment. 
4
Say not: "I have sinned, yet what has
befallen me?" for the LORD bides his time. 
5
Of forgiveness be not overconfident, adding sin
upon sin. 
6
Say not: "Great is his mercy; my many sins
he will forgive." 
7
For mercy and anger alike are with him; upon
the wicked alights his wrath. 
8
Delay not your conversion to the LORD, put it
not off from day to day; 
9
For suddenly his wrath flames forth; at the
time of vengeance, you will be destroyed. 
10
Rely not upon deceitful wealth, for it will be
no help on the day of wrath. 
11
[2]
 Winnow not in every wind, and start not off in
every direction. 
12
[3]
 Be consistent in your thoughts; steadfast be
your words. 
13
Be swift to hear, but slow to answer. 
14
If you have the knowledge, answer your
neighbor; if not, put your hand over your mouth. 
15
Honor and dishonor through talking! A man's
tongue can be his downfall. 
16
Be not called a detractor; use not your tongue
for calumny; 
17
For shame has been created for the thief, and
the reproach of his neighbor for the double-tongued.
