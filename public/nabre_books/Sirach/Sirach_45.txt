[1]
 From him was to spring the man who won the
favor of all: Dear to God and men, MOSES, whose memory is held in benediction. 
2
[2]
 God's honor devolved upon him, and the Lord
strengthened him with fearful powers; 
3
God wrought swift miracles at his words and
sustained him in the king's presence. He gave him the commandments for his
people, and revealed to him his glory. 
4
For his trustworthiness and meekness God
selected him from all mankind; 
5
[3]
 He permitted him to hear his voice, and led
him into the cloud, Where, face to face, he gave him the commandments, the law
of life and understanding, That he might teach his precepts to Jacob, his
judgments and decrees to Israel. 
6
[4]
 He raised up also, like Moses in holiness, his
brother AARON, of the tribe of Levi. 
7
[5]
 He made him perpetual in his office when he
bestowed on him the priesthood of his people; He established him in honor and
crowned him with lofty majesty; 
8
He clothed him with splendid apparel, and
adorned him with the glorious vestments: Breeches and tunic and robe with
pomegranates around the hem, 
9
And a rustle of bells round about, through
whose pleasing sound at each step He would be heard within the sanctuary, and
the children of his race would be remembered; 
10
The sacred vestments of gold, of violet, and of
crimson, wrought with embroidery; The breastpiece for decision, the ephod and
cincture 
11
with scarlet yarn, the work of the weaver;
Precious stones with seal engravings in golden settings, the work of the
jeweler, To commemorate in incised letters each of the tribes of Israel; 
12
On his turban the diadem of gold, its plate
wrought with the insignia of holiness, Majestic, glorious, renowned for
splendor, a delight to the eyes, beauty supreme. 
13
Before him, no one was adorned with these, nor
may they ever be worn by any Except his sons and them alone, generation after
generation, for all time. 
14
His cereal offering is wholly burnt with the
established sacrifice twice each day; 
15
For Moses ordained him and anointed him with
the holy oil, In a lasting covenant with him and with his family, as permanent
as the heavens, That he should serve God in his priesthood and bless his people
in his name. 
16
He chose him from all mankind to offer
holocausts and choice offerings, To burn sacrifices of sweet odor for a
memorial, and to atone for the people of Israel. 
17
He gave to him his laws, and authority to
prescribe and to judge: To teach the precepts to his people, and the ritual to
the descendants of Israel. 
18
Men of other families were inflamed against
him, were jealous of him in the desert, The followers of Dathan and Abiram, and
the band of Korah in their defiance. 
19
But the LORD saw this and became angry, he
destroyed them in his burning wrath. He brought down upon them a miracle, and
consumed them with his flaming fire. 
20
Then he increased the glory of Aaron and
bestowed upon him his inheritance: The sacred offerings he allotted to him,
with the showbread as his portion; 
21
The oblations of the LORD are his food, a gift
to him and his descendants. 
22
But he holds no land among the people nor
shares with them their heritage; For the LORD himself is his portion, his
inheritance in the midst of Israel. 
23
PHINEHAS too, the son of Eleazar, was the
courageous third of his line When, zealous for the God of all, he met the crisis
of his people And, at the prompting of his noble heart, atoned for the children
of Israel. 
24
Therefore on him again God conferred the right,
in a covenant of friendship, to provide for the sanctuary, So that he and his descendants
should possess the high priesthood forever. 
25
For even his covenant with David, the son of
Jesse of the tribe of Judah, Was an individual heritage through one son alone;
but the heritage of Aaron is for all his descendants. 
26
And now bless the LORD who has crowned you with
glory! May he grant you wisdom of heart to govern his people in justice, Lest
their welfare should ever be forgotten, or your authority, throughout all time.

 [1-5] Moses manifested God's power
through miracles (
⇒
 Sirach 45:1-3), God's authority
through the promulgation of the commandments and the law
(
⇒
 Sirach 45:5), and God's mercy through the
intimacy granted him by the Lord for his own faithfulness and meekness
(
⇒
 Sirach 45:4-5). The very personification of the
old covenant, Moses was also a type of Christ, the Prophet and Legislator of
the new; cf 
⇒
 Deut 18:15. 
2
 [2] God's honor devolved upon him:
Moses was actually God's substitute in dealing with Pharaoh, hence God
entrusted his own honor to Moses.
3
 [5] Face to face: on God's intimacy
with Moses, see 
⇒
 Exodus 33:11;
⇒
 Numbers 12:8. St. Paul alluded to this in
⇒
 1 Cor 13:12.
4
 [6-21] The author here expresses
his reverence and esteem for the priesthood of the old covenant. He recalls
God's choice of Aaron and his sons for this sublime office
(
⇒
 Sirach 45:6, 7), and
describes in detail the beauty of the high priest's vestments (
⇒
45:8-13). He relates the ordination of Aaron at the hands of Moses,
his brother (
⇒
 Sirach 45:15), and describes the
priestly functions, of offering sacrifice to God (
⇒
45:16), and of blessing (
⇒
 Sirach 45:15),
teaching, governing and judging the people (
⇒
45:17); the inheritance of the high priest
(
⇒
 Sirach 45:20-22); the punishment of those
families who were jealous of Aaron (
⇒
 Sirach 45:18,
⇒
 19); and the confirmation of the covenant of the
priesthood with Aaron's descendants through Phinehas (
⇒
45:23-25).
5
 [7] The priesthood of Aaron was
superseded by the priesthood of Christ; cf 
⇒
 Hebrews
7:18-28.
