1
No evil can harm the man who fears the LORD;
through trials, again and again he is safe. 
2
He who hates the law is without wisdom, and is
tossed about like a boat in a storm. 
3
[1]
 The prudent man trusts in the word of the
LORD, and the law is dependable for him as a divine oracle. 
4
Prepare your words and you will be listened to;
draw upon your training, and then give your answer. 
5
[2]
 Like the wheel of a cart is the mind of a
fool; his thoughts revolve in circles. 
6
A fickle friend is like the stallion that
neighs, no matter who the rider. 
7
Why is one day more important than another,
when it is the sun that lights up every day? 
8
It is due to the LORD'S wisdom that they
differ; it is through him the seasons and feasts come and go. 
9
Some he dignifies and sanctifies, and others he
lists as ordinary days. 
10
So too, all men are of clay, for from earth man
was formed; 
11
Yet with his great knowledge the LORD makes men
unlike; in different paths he has them walk. 
12
Some he blesses and makes great, some he
sanctifies and draws to himself. Others he curses and brings low, and expels
them from their place. 
13
Like clay in the hands of a potter, to be
molded according to his pleasure, So are men in the hands of their Creator, to
be assigned by him their function. 
14
As evil contrasts with good, and death with
life, so are sinners in contrast with the just; 
15
See now all the works of the Most High: they
come in pairs, the one the opposite of the other. 
16
[3]
 Now I am the last to keep vigil, like a
gleaner after the vintage; 
17
Since by the LORD'S blessing I have made
progress till like a vintager I have filled my wine press, 
18
I would inform you that not for myself only
have I toiled, but for every seeker after wisdom. 
19
[4]
 Listen to me, O leaders of the multitude; O
rulers of the assembly, give ear! 
20
Let neither son nor wife, neither brother nor
friend, have power over you as long as you live. 
21
While breath of life is still in you, let no
man have dominion over you. Give not to another your wealth, lest then you have
to plead with him; 
22
Far better that your children plead with you
than that you should look to their generosity. 
23
Keep control over all your affairs; let no one
tarnish your glory. 
24
When your few days reach their limit, at the
time of death distribute your inheritance. 
25
Fodder and whip and loads for an ass; the yoke
and harness and the rod of his master. 
27
Food, correction and work for a slave; and for
a wicked slave, punishment in the stocks. 
26
Make a slave work and he will look for his
rest; let his hands be idle and he will seek to be free. 
28
Force him to work that he be not idle, for
idleness is an apt teacher of mischief. 
29
Put him to work, for that is what befits him;
if he becomes unruly, load him with chains. 
30
But never lord it over any human being, and do
nothing unjust. 
31
If you have but one slave, treat him like yourself,
for you have acquired him with your life's blood; 
32
If you have but one slave, deal with him as a
brother, for you need him as you need your life: 
33
If you mistreat him and he runs away, in what
direction will you look for him?

 [3] Oracle: as the answer given
through the Urim and Thummim to the high priest is true, so the law proves
itself true to him who obeys it. Cf 
⇒
 Exodus 28:30;
⇒
 Numbers 27:21.

 [5-15] Contrasts observable in the
physical universe as well as in the moral order serve the purposes of divine
wisdom (
⇒
 Sirach 33:5-9). All creatures are like
clay. . . in the hands of their Creator - the fool and the wise man, the
sinner, and the just (
⇒
 Sirach 33:10-15). This does
not imply that man is created to be a sinner: God is not the author of
wickedness. Cf
⇒
 James 1:13-14.

 [16-18] Here the author refers to
himself as the most recent of the writers who have endeavored to present true
wisdom to their readers.
4
 [19-33] Public officials should
reject every influence that would restrict their freedom in the management of
their affairs. They must make their own household subservient to them rather
than be subservient to it (
⇒
 Sirach 33:19-24).
Slaves are to be given food and work and correction but never to be treated
unjustly (
⇒
 Sirach 33:25-29). Great care should be
taken of good slaves (
⇒
 Sirach 33:30-33).
