1
The poor man's wisdom lifts his head high and
sets him among princes. 
2
Praise not a man for his looks; despise not a
man for his appearance. 
3
Least is the bee among winged things, but she
reaps the choicest of all harvests. 
4
Mock not the worn cloak and jibe at no man's
bitter day: For strange are the works of the LORD, hidden from men his deeds. 
5
[1]
 The oppressed often rise to a throne, and some
that none would consider wear a crown. 
6
The exalted often fall into utter disgrace; the
honored are given into enemy hands. 
7
[2]
 Before investigating, find no fault; examine
first, then criticize. 
8
Before hearing, answer not, and interrupt no
one in the middle of his speech. 
9
Dispute not about what is not your concern; in
the strife of the arrogant take no part. 
10
My son, why increase your cares, since he who
is avid for wealth will not be blameless? Even if you run after it, you will
never overtake it; however you seek it, you will not find it. 
11
One may toil and struggle and drive, and fall
short all the more. 
12
Another goes his way a weakling and a failure,
with little strength and great misery - 
Yet the eyes of the LORD look favorably upon him; he raises him free of
the vile dust, 
13
Lifts up his head and exalts him to the
amazement of the many. 
14
[3]
 Good and evil, life and death, poverty and
riches, are from the LORD. 
15
[4]
 Wisdom and understanding and knowledge of
affairs, love and virtuous paths are from the LORD. 
16
Error and darkness were formed with sinners
from their birth, and evil grows old with evildoers. 
17
The LORD'S gift remains with the just; his
favor brings continued success. 
18
A man may become rich through a miser's life,
and this is his allotted reward: 
19
[5]
 When he says: "I have found rest, now I
will feast on my possessions," He does not know how long it will be till
he dies and leaves them to others. 
20
My son, hold fast to your duty, busy yourself
with it, grow old while doing your task. 
21
Admire not how sinners live, but trust in the LORD
and wait for his light; For it is easy with the LORD suddenly, in an instant,
to make a poor man rich. 
22
God's blessing is the lot of the just man, and
in due time his hopes bear fruit. 
23
Say not: "What do I need? What further
pleasure can be mine?" 
24
Say not: "I am independent. What harm can
come to me now?" 
25
The day of prosperity makes one forget
adversity; the day of adversity makes one forget prosperity. 
26
[6]
 For it is easy with the LORD on the day of
death to repay man according to his deeds. 
27
A moment's affliction brings forgetfulness of
past delights; when a man dies, his life is revealed. 
28
Call no man happy before his death, for by how
he ends, a man is known. 
29
Bring not every man into your house, for many
are the snares of the crafty one; 
30
Though he seem like a bird confined in a cage,
yet like a spy he will pick out the weak spots. 
31
The talebearer turns good into evil; with a
spark he sets many coals afire. 
32
The evil man lies in wait for blood, and plots
against your choicest possessions. 
33
Avoid a wicked man, for he breeds only evil,
lest you incur a lasting stain. 
34
Lodge a stranger with you, and he will subvert
your course, and make a stranger of you to your own household.
