 Now will I praise those
godly men, our ancestors, each in his own time: 
2
The abounding glory of the Most High's portion,
his own part, since the days of old. Subduers of the land in kingly fashion,
men of renown for their might, 
3
Or counselors in their prudence, or seers of
all things in prophecy; 
4
Resolute princes of the folk, and governors
with their staves; Authors skilled in composition, and forgers of epigrams with
their spikes; 
5
Composers of melodious psalms, or discoursers
on lyric themes; 
6
Stalwart men, solidly established and at peace
in their own estates -  
7
All these were glorious in their time, each
illustrious in his day. 
8
Some of them have left behind a name and men recount
their praiseworthy deeds; 
9
But of others there is no memory, for when they
ceased, they ceased. And they are as though they had not lived, they and their
children after them. 
10
Yet these also were godly men whose virtues
have not been forgotten; 
11
Their wealth remains in their families, their
heritage with their descendants; 
12
Through God's covenant with them their family
endures, their posterity, for their sake. 
13
And for all time their progeny will endure,
their glory will never be blotted out; 
14
Their bodies are peacefully laid away, but
their name lives on and on. 
15
At gatherings their wisdom is retold, and the
assembly proclaims their praise.

 [ENOCH walked with the LORD and was taken up,
that succeeding generations might learn by his example.] 
17
NOAH, found just and perfect, renewed the race in
the time of devastation. Because of his worth there were survivors, and with a
sign to him the deluge ended; 
18
A lasting agreement was made with him, that
never should all flesh be destroyed. 
19
ABRAHAM, father of many peoples, kept his glory
without stain: 
20
[4]
 He observed the precepts of the Most High, and
entered into an agreement with him; In his own flesh he incised the ordinance,
and when tested he was found loyal. 
21
[5]
 For this reason, God promised him with an oath
that in his descendants the nations would be blessed, That he would make him
numerous as the grains of dust, and exalt his posterity like the stars; That he
would give them an inheritance from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends
of the earth. 
22
And for ISAAC he renewed the same promise
because of Abraham, his father. The covenant with all his forebears was
confirmed, and the blessing rested upon the head of JACOB. 
23
God acknowledged him as the first-born, and
gave him his inheritance. He fixed the boundaries for his tribes, and their
division into twelve.

 50:24] As in
the previous section God's wisdom shone forth in the works of nature, so in
these chapters it is also revealed through the history of God's people as seen
in the lives of their patriarchs, prophets, priests and rulers. The example of
these great men, whose virtues are here recalled, constitutes a high point of
the author's teaching and illustrates his belief in the canonical Scriptures.
