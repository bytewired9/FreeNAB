Till like a fire there appeared the prophet
whose words were as a flaming furnace. 
2
Their staff of bread he shattered, in his zeal
he reduced them to straits; 
3
By God's word he shut up the heavens and three
times brought down fire. 
4
How awesome are you, ELIJAH! Whose glory is
equal to yours? 
5
You brought a dead man back to life from the
nether world, by the will of the LORD. 
6
You sent kings down to destruction, and nobles,
from their beds of sickness. 
7
You heard threats at Sinai, at Horeb avenging
judgments. 
8
You anointed kings who should inflict
vengeance, and a prophet as your successor. 
9
You were taken aloft in a whirlwind, in a
chariot with fiery horses. 
10
You are destined, it is written, in time to
come to put an end to wrath before the day of the LORD, To turn back the hearts
of fathers toward their sons, and to reestablish the tribes of Jacob. 
11
Blessed is he who shall have seen you before he
dies,

 O Elijah, enveloped in the whirlwind! Then
ELISHA, filled with a twofold portion of his spirit, wrought many marvels by
his mere word. During his lifetime he feared no one, nor was any man able to
intimidate his will. 
13
Nothing was beyond his power; beneath him flesh
was brought back into life. 
14
In life he performed wonders, and after death,
marvelous deeds. 
15
Despite all this the people did not repent, nor
did they give up their sins, Until they were rooted out of their land and
scattered all over the earth. But Judah remained, a tiny people, with its
rulers from the house of David. 
16
Some of these did what was right, but others
were extremely sinful. 
17
[2]
 HEZEKIAH fortified his city and had water
brought into it; With iron tools he cut through the rock and he built
reservoirs for water. 
18
During his reign Sennacherib led an invasion
and sent his adjutant; He shook his fist at Zion and blasphemed God in his
pride. 
19
The people's hearts melted within them, and
they were in anguish like that of childbirth. 
20
But they called upon the Most High God and lifted
up their hands to him; He heard the prayer they uttered, and saved them through
ISAIAH. 
21
God struck the camp of the Assyrians and routed
them with a plague. 
22
For Hezekiah did what was right and held fast
to the paths of David, As ordered by the illustrious prophet Isaiah, who saw
the truth in visions. 
23
In his lifetime he turned back the sun and
prolonged the life of the king. 
24
By his powerful spirit he looked into the future
and consoled the mourners of Zion; 
25
He foretold what should be till the end of
time, hidden things yet to be fulfilled.

 [12-16] Elisha fearlessly continued
the work of his predecessor by numerous miracles (
⇒
48:12-14), but the obstinacy of the people eventually brought on the
destruction of the kingdom of Israel and the dispersion of its subjects. Judah,
however, survived under the rule of Davidic kings, both good and bad
(
⇒
 Sirach 48:15-16). 
2
 [17-25] The fidelity, trust and
courage of King Hezekiah (
⇒
 Sirach 48:17,
⇒
 22), the zeal of the prophet Isaiah, and the
prayer of the people (
⇒
 Sirach 48:20) availed with
God. The Assyrian oppressors were routed (
⇒
48:18-19, 
⇒
 21), the king's life was
prolonged, and consolations were granted the people through Isaiah's prophecies
concerning the future (
⇒
 Sirach 48:23-25),
especially the coming of the Messiah and the establishment of his kingdom; cf
⇒
 Isaiah 7:14; 
⇒
 9:6-7;
40-65.
