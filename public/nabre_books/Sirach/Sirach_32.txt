If you are chosen to preside at dinner, be not
puffed up, but with the guests be as one of themselves; Take care of them first
before you sit down; 
2
when you have fulfilled your duty, then take
your place, To share in their joy and win praise for your hospitality. 
3
Being older, you may talk; that is only your
right, but temper your wisdom, not to disturb the singing. 
4
When wine is present, do not pour out
discourse, and flaunt not your wisdom at the wrong time. 
5
Like a seal of carnelian in a setting of gold
is a concert when wine is served. 
6
Like a gold mounting with an emerald seal is
string music with delicious wine. 
7
Young man, speak only when necessary, when they
have asked you more than once; 
8
Be brief, but say much in those few words, be
like the wise man, taciturn. 
9
When among your elders be not forward, and with
officials be not too insistent. 
10
Like the lightning that flashes before a storm
is the esteem that shines on modesty. 
11
When it is time to leave, tarry not; be off for
home! There take your ease, 
12
And there enjoy doing as you wish, but without
sin or words of pride. 
13
Above all, give praise to your Creator, who
showers his favors upon you. 
14
[1]
 He who would find God must accept discipline;
he who seeks him obtains his request. 
15
He who studies the law masters it, but the
hypocrite finds it a trap. 
16
His judgment is sound who fears the LORD; out
of obscurity he draws forth a clear plan. 
17
The sinner turns aside reproof and distorts the
law to suit his purpose. 
18
The thoughtful man will not neglect direction;
the proud and insolent man is deterred by nothing. 
19
Do nothing without counsel, and then you need
have no regrets. 
20
Go not on a way that is set with snares, and
let not the same thing trip you twice. 
21
Be not too sure even of smooth roads, 
22
be careful on all your paths. 
23
Whatever you do, be on your guard, for in this
way you will keep the commandments. 
24
He who keeps the law preserves himself; and he
who trusts in the LORD shall not be put to shame.

[
⇒
 32:14-
⇒
 33:4] God is
shown to reveal himself through the discipline of his law, a clear and safe
plan of life for the pious Jew of old. Direction and counsel are aids in
following it (
⇒
 Sirach 32:14-16,
⇒
 18-24; 
⇒
 33:1,
3, 4). Sinners and
hypocrites, hating the law or distorting it, fail in wisdom and are devoid of
security (

 Sirach 32:15,
⇒
 17-18; 
⇒
 33:2).
