 A great anxiety has God
allotted, and a heavy yoke, to the sons of men; From the day one leaves his
mother's womb to the day he returns to the mother of all the living, 
2
His thoughts, the fear in his heart, and his
troubled forebodings till the day he dies - 
3
Whether he sits on a lofty throne or grovels in
dust and ashes, 
4
Whether he bears a splendid crown or is wrapped
in the coarsest of cloaks -  
5
Are of wrath and envy, trouble and dread,
terror of death, fury and strife. Even when he lies on his bed to rest, his
cares at night disturb his sleep. 
6
So short is his rest it seems like none, till
in his dreams he struggles as he did by day, Terrified by what his mind's eye
sees, like a fugitive being pursued; 
7
As he reaches safety, he wakes up astonished
that there was nothing to fear. 
8
So it is with all flesh, with man and with
beast, but for sinners seven times more. 
9
Plague and bloodshed, wrath and the sword,
plunder and ruin, famine and death: 
10
For the wicked, these were created evil, and it
is they who bring on destruction. 
11
[3]
 All that is of earth returns to earth, and
what is from above returns above. 
12
All that comes from bribes or injustice will be
wiped out, but loyalty remains for ages. 
13
Wealth out of wickedness is like a wadi in
spate: like a mighty stream with lightning and thunder, 
14
Which, in its rising, rolls along the stones,
but suddenly, once and for all, comes to an end. 
15
The offshoot of violence will not flourish, for
the root of the godless is on sheer rock; 
16
Or they are like reeds on the riverbank,
withered before all other plants; 
17
[4]
 But goodness will never be cut off, and
justice endures forever. Wealth or wages can make life sweet, but better than
either is finding a treasure. 
18
A child or a city will preserve one's name, but
better than either, attaining wisdom. 
19
Sheepfolds and orchards bring flourishing
health; but better than either, a devoted wife; 
20
Wine and music delight the soul, but better
than either, conjugal love. 
21
The flute and the harp offer sweet melody, but
better than either, a voice that is true. 
22
Charm and beauty delight the eye, but better
than either, the flowers of the field. 
23
A friend, a neighbor, are timely guides, but
better than either, a prudent wife. 
24
A brother, a helper, for times of stress; but
better than either, charity that rescues. 
25
Gold and silver make one's way secure, but
better than either, sound judgment. 
26
Wealth and vigor build up confidence, but
better than either, fear of God. Fear of the LORD leaves nothing wanting; he
who has it need seek no other support: 
27
The fear of God is a paradise of blessings; its
canopy, all that is glorious. 
28
[5]
 My son, live not the life of a beggar, better
to die than to beg; 
29
When one has to look to another's table, his
life is not really a life. His neighbor's delicacies bring revulsion of spirit
to one who understands inward feelings: 
30
In the mouth of the shameless man begging is
sweet, but within him it burns like fire.

 [1-16] The former idyllic
description of the universe is contrasted with the picture of the evils
afflicting humanity. Every man, high or low, is burdened from birth to death
with fears, anxieties and troubles, by day and often by night, the time appointed
for rest (
⇒
 Sirach 40:1-7). For sinners, the
suffering is much greater (
⇒
 Sirach 40:8-10). What
they gained by violence and injustice is quickly destroyed; but justice endures
forever (
⇒
 Sirach 40:14-16).
2
 [1] Mother of all the living: the
earth from which man was taken. Cf 
⇒
 Genesis 2:7;
⇒
 3:19-20; 
⇒
 Job 1:21;
⇒
 Psalm 139:15. 
3
 [11] All that is of earth . . .
returns above: a reference to bodily mortality and to the divine origin of life
from the Spirit of God. Cf 
⇒
 Sirach 41:10;
⇒
 Genesis 2:7; 
⇒
 3:19;
⇒
 Job 34:14-15; 
⇒
 Psalm
104:29-30; 
⇒
 146:4;
⇒
 Eccl 12:7. The Greek and the Latin render the
second half of the verse: "all waters shall return to the sea."
4
 [17-27] Of the many treasures
making life sweet, such as health, children, friends, music, vigor, the best
are called true conjugal love, wisdom, and above all, fear of God; cf
⇒
 Sirach 25:6-11.
5
 [28-30] Among the Jews, beggary was
considered degrading to human dignity; it was agreeable only to the shameless,
who had lost their sense of honor. Cf 
⇒
29:22-23.
