 My son, rob not the poor man of his
livelihood; force not the eyes of the needy to turn away. 
2
A hungry man grieve not, a needy man anger not;
3
Do not exasperate the downtrodden; delay not to
give to the needy. 
4
A beggar in distress do not reject; avert not
your face from the poor. 
5
From the needy turn not your eyes, give no man
reason to curse you; 
6
For if in the bitterness of his soul he curse
you, his Creator will hear his prayer. 
7
Endear yourself to the assembly; before a ruler
bow your head. 
8
Give a hearing to the poor man, and return his
greeting with courtesy; 
9
Deliver the oppressed from the hand of the
oppressor; let not justice be repugnant to you. 
10
To the fatherless be as a father, and help
their mother as a husband would; Thus will you be like a son to the Most High,
and he will be more tender to you than a mother. 
11
[2]
 Wisdom instructs her children and admonishes
those who seek her. 
12
He who loves her loves life; those who seek her
out win her favor. 
13
He who holds her fast inherits glory; wherever he
dwells, the LORD bestows blessings. 
14
Those who serve her serve the Holy One; those
who love her the LORD loves. 
15
He who obeys her judges nations; he who
hearkens to her dwells in her inmost chambers. 
16
If one trusts her, he will possess her; his
descendants too will inherit her. 
17
She walks with him as a stranger, and at first
she puts him to the test; Fear and dread she brings upon him and tries him with
her discipline; With her precepts she puts him to the proof, until his heart is
fully with her. 
18
Then she comes back to bring him happiness and
reveal her secrets to him. 
19
But if he fails her, she will abandon him and
deliver him into the hands of despoilers. 
20
[3]
 Use your time well; guard yourself from evil,
and bring upon yourself no shame. 
21
There is a sense of shame laden with guilt, and
a shame that merits honor and respect. 
22
Show no favoritism to your own discredit; let
no one intimidate you to your own downfall. 
23
Refrain not from speaking at the proper time,
and hide not away your wisdom; 
24
For it is through speech that wisdom becomes
known, and knowledge through the tongue's rejoinder. 
25
Never gainsay the truth, and struggle not
against the rushing stream. 
26
Be not ashamed to acknowledge your guilt, but
of your ignorance rather be ashamed. 
27
Do not abase yourself before an impious man,
nor refuse to do so before rulers. 
28
Even to the death fight for truth, and the LORD
your God will battle for you. 
29
Be not surly in your speech, nor lazy and slack
in your deeds. 
30
Be not a lion at home, nor sly and suspicious
at work. 
31
Let not your hand be open to receive and
clenched when it is time to give.

 [1] Eyes of the needy: when they
look for help; cf 
⇒
 Sirach 18:17.

 [11-19] The Hebrew text presents
wisdom speaking in the first person, as in Sirach 24. The precious fruits of
wisdom: life, favor, glory, blessings, God's love, are intended to arouse
desire for her (
⇒
 Sirach 4:11-14). Her disciples are
like priests (
⇒
 Sirach 4:14) and judges
(
⇒
 Sirach 4:15), even partners who possess her for
themselves and their descendants (
⇒
 Sirach 4:16).
They enjoy happiness and penetrate her profound secrets after surviving her
tests (
⇒
 Sirach 4:17,
⇒
 18). Those who fail her are abandoned to
destruction (
⇒
 Sirach 4:19).
3
 [20-31] Besides the interior trials
of discipline and precept, the disciple of wisdom is warned against external
dangers to his sincerity and justice, namely evil, human respect
(
⇒
 Sirach 4:20, 
⇒
 21),
compromise of liberty in speech and action (
⇒
4:22-25), false shame, and ignorance (
⇒
4:26). He must fight for the truth (
⇒
4:28), and avoid cynicism and laziness (
⇒
4:29), and inconsistency in his conduct (
⇒
4:30).
