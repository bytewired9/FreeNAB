[1]
 The Eternal is the judge of all things without
exception; the LORD alone is just. 
2
Whom has he made equal to describing his works,
and who can probe his mighty deeds? 
3
Who can measure his majestic power, or exhaust
the tale of his mercies? 
4
One cannot lessen, nor increase, nor penetrate
the wonders of the LORD. 
5
When a man ends he is only beginning, and when
he stops he is still bewildered. 
6
What is man, of what worth is he? the good, the
evil in him, what are these? 
7
The sum of a man's days is great if it reaches
a hundred years: 
8
Like a drop of sea water, like a grain of sand,
so are these few years among the days of eternity. 
9
That is why the LORD is patient with men and
showers upon them his mercy. 
10
He sees and understands that their death is
grievous, and so he forgives them all the more. 
11
Man may be merciful to his fellow man, but the
LORD'S mercy reaches all flesh, 
12
Reproving, admonishing, teaching, as a shepherd
guides his flock; 
13
Merciful to those who accept his guidance, who
are diligent in his precepts. 
14
[2]
 My son, to your charity add no reproach, nor
spoil any gift by harsh words. 
15
Like dew that abates a burning wind, so does a
word improve a gift. 
16
Sometimes the word means more than the gift;
both are offered by a kindly man. 
17
Only a fool upbraids before giving; a grudging
gift wears out the expectant eyes. 
18
Be informed before speaking; before sickness
prepare the cure. 
19
[3]
 Before you are judged, seek merit for
yourself, and at the time of visitation you will have a ransom. 
20
Before you have fallen, humble yourself; when
you have sinned, show repentance. 
21
Delay not to forsake sins, neglect it not till
you are in distress. 
22
[4]
 Let nothing prevent the prompt payment of your
vows; wait not to fulfill them when you are dying. 
23
Before making a vow have the means to fulfill
it; be not one who tries the LORD. 
24
Think of wrath and the day of death, the time
of vengeance when he will hide his face. 
25
Remember the time of hunger in the time of
plenty, poverty and want in the day of wealth. 
26
Between morning and evening the weather
changes; before the LORD all things are fleeting. 
27
A wise man is circumspect in all things; when
sin is rife he keeps himself from wrongdoing. 
28
[5]
 Any learned man should make wisdom known, and
he who attains to her should declare her praise; 
29
Those trained in her words must show their
wisdom, dispensing sound proverbs like life-giving waters. 
30
[6]
 Go not after your lusts, but keep your desires
in check. 
31
If you satisfy your lustful appetites they will
make you the sport of your enemies. 
32
Have no joy in the pleasures of a moment which
bring on poverty redoubled; 
33
Become not a glutton and a winebibber with
nothing in your purse.

 [1-13] Not only are God's justice
and power beyond man's understanding (
⇒
18:1-5), his mercy also is boundless and surpasses all human
compassion (
⇒
 Sirach 18:6-13). 
2
 [14-27] The practice of charity is
an art which avoids every offense to the recipient (
⇒
18:14-18). Prudence directs the changing circumstances of daily life
toward the attainment of its reward at the time of visitation, i.e., the day of
reckoning (
⇒
 Sirach 18:19-27).

 [19] Merit . . . ransom: almsgiving
is often portrayed in the Bible as a means of approach to the forgiving mercy
of God. Cf

 [22-23] The usual object of a vow
in Old Testament times was the offering of a bloody sacrifice.

 [28-29] A general statement on the
teaching of wisdom, serving either as a conclusion to the preceding section or
as an introduction to the following one. The neighbors of the wise man are
regarded as the field into which he channels the waters of wisdom to encourage
growth. Cf

 Sirach 24:28-31.

Inordinate gratification of the senses makes a man unreasonable, the slave of
passion, the sport of his enemies. In the end it destroys him physically and
spiritually.
