Since we have these promises, beloved, let us
cleanse ourselves from every defilement of flesh and spirit, making holiness
perfect in the fear of God. 
2
[1]
 Make room for us; we have not wronged anyone,
or ruined anyone, or taken advantage of anyone. 
3
I do not say this in condemnation, for I have
already said that you are in our hearts, that we may die together and live
together. 
4
I have great confidence in you, I have great
pride in you; I am filled with encouragement, I am overflowing with joy all the
more because of all our affliction. 
5
[2]
[3]
[4]
 For
even when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted
in every way - external conflicts, internal fears. 
6
But God, who encourages the downcast,
encouraged us by the arrival of Titus, 
7
and not only by his arrival but also by the
encouragement with which he was encouraged in regard to you, as he told us of
your yearning, your lament, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more. 
8
[5]
 For even if I saddened you by my letter, I do
not regret it; and if I did regret it ((for) I see that that letter saddened
you, if only for a while), 
9
I rejoice now, not because you were saddened,
but because you were saddened into repentance; for you were saddened in a godly
way, so that you did not suffer loss in anything because of us. 
10
For godly sorrow produces a salutary repentance
without regret, but worldly sorrow produces death. 
11
For behold what earnestness this godly sorrow
has produced for you, as well as readiness for a defense, and indignation, and
fear, and yearning, and zeal, and punishment. In every way you have shown
yourselves to be innocent in the matter. 
12
So then even though I wrote to you, it was not
on account of the one who did the wrong, or on account of the one who suffered
the wrong, but in order that your concern for us might be made plain to you in
the sight of God. 
13
For this reason we are encouraged. And besides
our encouragement, 
[6]
 we rejoice even more because of the joy
of Titus, since his spirit has been refreshed by all of you. 
14
For if I have boasted to him about you, I was
not put to shame. No, just as everything we said to you was true, so our
boasting before Titus proved to be the truth. 
15
And his heart goes out to you all the more, as
he remembers the obedience of all of you, when you received him with fear and
trembling. 
16
I rejoice, because I have confidence in you in
every respect.

 [2-4] These verses continue the
thought of 
⇒
 2 Cor 6:11-13, before the interruption
of 
⇒
 2 Cor 6:14-
⇒
 7:1.
⇒
 2 Cor 7:4 serves as a transition to the next
section: the four themes it introduces (confidence; pride or
"boasting"; encouragement; joy in affliction) are developed in
⇒
 2 Cor 7:5-16. All have appeared previously in the
letter. 
2
 [5-16] This section functions as a
peroration or formal summing up of the whole first part of the letter,
⇒
 2 Cor 7:1-7. It deals with the restoration of
right relations between Paul and the Corinthians, and it is marked by fullness
and intensity of emotion.
3
 [5-7] Paul picks up the thread of
the narrativeinterrupted at 
⇒
 2 Cor 2:13
(
⇒
 2 Cor 7:5) and describes the resolution of the
tense situation there depicted (
⇒
 2 Cor 7:6-7).
Finally Titus arrives and his coming puts an end to Paul's restlessness
(
⇒
 2 Cor 2:13; 
⇒
 2 Cor
7:5), casts out his fears, and reverses his mood. The theme of
encouragement and affliction is reintroduced (cf 
⇒
 2 Cor 1:3-11);
here, too, encouragement is traced back to God and is described as contagious
(
⇒
 2 Cor 7:6). The language of joy and sorrow also
reappears in 
⇒
 2 Cor 7:7 (cf 
⇒
 2
Cor 1:23-
⇒
 2:1 and the note on
⇒
 2 Cor 1:23-24).
4
 [5] Macedonia: see the note on
⇒
 2 Cor 2:13.
5
 [8-12] Paul looks back on the
episode from the viewpoint of its ending. The goal of their common activity,
promotion of their joy (
⇒
 2 Cor 1:24), has been
achieved, despite and because of the sorrow they felt. That sorrow was
God-given. Its salutary effects are enumerated fully and impressively in
⇒
 2 Cor 7:10-11; not the least important of these
is that it has revealed to them the attachment they have to Paul.
6
 [13-16] Paul summarizes the effect
of the experience on Titus: encouragement, joy, love, relief. Finally, he
describes its effects on himself: encouragement, joy, confidence, pride or
"boasting" (i.e., the satisfaction resulting from a boast that proves
well-founded; cf 
⇒
 2 Cor 7:4; 
⇒
 1:12,
⇒
 14).
