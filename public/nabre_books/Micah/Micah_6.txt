1
Hear, then, what the LORD says: Arise, present
your plea before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice! 
2
Hear, O mountains, the plea of the LORD, pay
attention, O foundations of the earth! For the LORD has a plea against his
people, and he enters into trial with Israel. 
3
O my people, what have I done to you, or how
have I wearied you? Answer me! 
4
For I brought you up from the land of Egypt,
from the place of slavery I released you; And I sent before you Moses, Aaron,
and Miriam. 
5
[1]
 My people, remember what Moab's King Balak
planned, and how Balaam, the son of Beor, answered him . . . from Shittim to
Gilgal, that you may know the just deeds of the LORD. 
6
[2]
 With what shall I come before the LORD, and
bow before God most high? Shall I come before him with holocausts, with calves
a year old? 
7
[3]
 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of
rams, with myriad streams of oil? Shall I give my first-born for my crime, the
fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? 
8
You have been told, O man, what is good, and
what the LORD requires of you: Only to do right and to love goodness, and to
walk humbly with your God. 
9
[4]
 Hark! the LORD cries to the city. (It is
wisdom to fear your name!) Hear, O tribe and city council, 
12
You whose rich men are full of violence, whose
inhabitants speak falsehood with deceitful tongues in their heads! 
10
Am I to bear any longer criminal hoarding and
the meager ephah that is accursed? 
11
Shall I acquit criminal balances, bags of false
weights? 
13
Rather I will begin to strike you with
devastation because of your sins. 
15
You shall sow, yet not reap, tread out the
olive, yet pour no oil, and the grapes, yet drink no wine. 
14
You shall eat, without being satisfied, food
that will leave you empty; What you acquire, you cannot save; what you do save,
I will deliver up to the sword. 
16
[5]
 You have kept the decrees of Omri, and all the
works of the house of Ahab, and you have walked in their counsels; Therefore I
will deliver you up to ruin, and your citizens to derision; and you shall bear
the reproach of the nations. 
1
 [5] From Shittim to Gilgal: from
the east to the west side of the Jordan; the events described in Joshua 3-5 are
meant. The text is defective; however, it is evident that this verse continues
the remembrance of God's deeds of mercy to Israel, beginning with the Exodus
(
⇒
 Micah 6:4) and extending to the conquest, deeds
which have provoked so little response from his people. 
2
 [6-8] The people ask how they shall
worship the Lord, proposing the various forms of sacrifice. The prophet replies
that sacrifice avails nothing without the true spirit of religion. This is one
of the best expressions of the prophetic teaching on religion, the preparation
for such New Testament passages as 
⇒
 James 1:27.
3
 [7] Shall I give my first-born:
through Canaanite influence the abominable practice of human sacrifice had been
introduced under impious kings (cf 
⇒
 2 Kings 16:3;
⇒
 21:6).
4
 [9] The city: Jerusalem as the
embodiment of the crimes of the entire land.
5
 [16] Judah has followed the example
of the northern kingdom epitomized in the semipaganism of Omri and his son Ahab
(
⇒
 1 Kings 16:25-34), copying both the corrupted
worship and the social injustice of their reigns.
