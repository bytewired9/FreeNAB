Introduction
Micah was a
contemporary of Isaiah. Of his personal life and call we know nothing except
that he came from the obscure village of Moresheth in the foothills. His were
the broad vistas of the Judean lowland and the distant sea on the western
horizon. With burning eloquence he attacked the rich exploiters of the poor,
fraudulent merchants, venal judges, corrupt priests and prophets. To the man of
the countryside the vices of the nation seemed centered in its capitals, for
both Samaria and Jerusalem are singled out for judgment. An interesting notice
in 
⇒
 Jeremiah 26:17,
⇒
 18 informs us that the reform of Hezekiah was
influenced by the preaching of Micah.
The prophecy may be divided
into three parts: I: The impending judgment of the Lord, followed by an exposition
of its causes, Israel's sins. Censure of Judah's leaders for betrayal of their
responsibility. (
⇒
1:1-
⇒
 3:12) II: The glory of the restored
Zion. A prince of David's house will rule over a reunited Israel. (St.
Matthew's Nativity narrative points to Christ's birth in Bethlehem as the
fulfillment of this propehecy.) A remnant shall survive the chastisement of
Judah and her adversaries shall be destroyed. (
⇒
4:1-
⇒
 5:14) III: The case against Israel,
in which the Lord is portrayed as the plaintiff who has maintained fidelity to
the covenant. The somber picture closes with a prayer for national restoration
and a beautiful expression of trust in God's pardoning mercy.

 Micah 6:1-
⇒
 7:20)
It should be noted that
each of these three divisions begins with reproach and the threat of
punishment, and ends on a note of hope and promise.
