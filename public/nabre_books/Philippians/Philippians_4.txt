[1]
 Therefore, my brothers, whom I love and long
for, my joy and crown, in this way stand firm in the Lord, beloved. 
2
I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche 
[2]
to come to a mutual understanding in the Lord. 
3
Yes, and I ask you also, my true yokemate, 
[3]
to help them, for they have struggled at my side in promoting the gospel, along
with Clement and my other co-workers, whose names are in the book of life. 
4
Rejoice 
[4]
 in the Lord
always. I shall say it again: rejoice! 
5
Your kindness 
[5]
 should be
known to all. The Lord is near. 
6
Have no anxiety at all, but in everything, by
prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God. 
7
Then the peace of God that surpasses all
understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. 
8
Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever
is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever
is gracious, if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of
praise, think about these things. 
[6]
9
Keep on doing what you have learned and
received and heard and seen in me. Then the God of peace will be with you. 
[7]
10
[8]
 I rejoice greatly in the Lord that now at last
you revived your concern for me. You were, of course, concerned about me but
lacked an opportunity. 
11
Not that I say this because of need, for I have
learned, in whatever situation I find myself, to be self-sufficient. 
12
I know indeed how to live in humble
circumstances; I know also how to live with abundance. In every circumstance
and in all things I have learned the secret of being well fed and of going
hungry, of living in abundance and of being in need. 
13
I have the strength for everything through him
who empowers me. 
14
Still, it was kind of you to share in my
distress. 
15
You Philippians indeed know that at the
beginning of the gospel, 
[9]
 when I left Macedonia, not a
single church shared with me in an account of giving and receiving, except you
alone. 
16
For even when I was at Thessalonica you sent me
something for my needs, not only once but more than once. 
17
It is not that I am eager for the gift; rather,
I am eager for the profit that accrues to your account. 
18
I have received full payment and I abound. I am
very well supplied because of what I received from you through Epaphroditus,
"a fragrant aroma," an acceptable sacrifice, 
[10]
pleasing to God. 
19
My God will fully supply whatever you need, in
accord with his glorious riches in Christ Jesus. 
20
To our God and Father, glory forever and ever.
Amen. 
21
[11]
 Give my greetings to every holy one in Christ
Jesus. The brothers who are with me send you their greetings; 
22
all the holy ones send you their greetings,
especially those of Caesar's household. 
[12]
23
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your
spirit. 
1
 [1-9] This series of ethical
admonitions rests especially on the view of Christ and his coming (cf
⇒
 Philippians 4:5) in 
⇒
3:20-21. Paul's instructions touch on unity within the congregation,
joy, prayer, and the Christian outlook on life. 
2
 [2] Euodia . . . Syntyche: two otherwise unknown women in the
Philippian congregation; on the advice to them, cf
⇒
 Philippians 2:2-4.
3
 [3] Yokemate: or
"comrade," although the Greek syzygos could also be a proper name.
Clement: otherwise unknown, although later writers sought to identify him with
Clement, bishop of Rome (Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History 3.15.1).
4
 [4] Rejoice: see the note on
⇒
 Philippians 3:1.
5
 [5] Kindness: considerateness,
forbearance, fairness. The Lord is near: most likely a reference to Christ's
parousia (
⇒
 Philippians 1:6,
⇒
 10; 
⇒
 3:20-21;
⇒
 1 Cor 16:22), although some sense an echo of
⇒
 Psalm 119:151 and the perpetual presence of the
Lord.

 [8] The language employs terms from
Roman Stoic thought.

 [9] Cf the note on
⇒
 Philippians 3:17.
8
 [10-20] Paul, more directly than
anywhere else in the letter (cf 
⇒
 Philippians 1:3-5),
here thanks the Philippians for their gift of money sent through Epaphroditus
(
⇒
 Philippians 2:25). Paul's own policy was to be
self-sufficient as a missionary, supporting himself by his own labor
(
⇒
 1 Thes 2:5-9; 
⇒
 1 Cor
9:15-18; cf 
⇒
 Acts 18:2-3). In spite of
this reliance on self and on God to provide (
⇒
4:11-13) Paul accepted gifts from the Philippians not only once but
more than once (
⇒
 Philippians 4:16) when he was in
Thessalonica (
⇒
 Acts 17:1-9), as he does now, in
prison (my distress, 
⇒
 Philippians 4:14). While
commercial terms appear in the passage, like an account of giving and receiving
(
⇒
 Philippians 4:15) and received full payment
(
⇒
 Philippians 4:18), Paul is most concerned about
the spiritual growth of the Philippians (10.17.19); he emphasizes that God will
care for their needs, through Christ.
9
 [15] The beginning of the gospel:
it was at Philippi that Paul first preached Christ in Europe, going on from
there to Thessalonica and Beroea (
⇒
 Acts
16:9-
⇒
 17:14).
10
 [18] Aroma . . . sacrifice: Old
Testament cultic language (cf 
⇒
 Genesis 8:21;
⇒
 Exodus 29:18, 
⇒
 25,
⇒
 41; 
⇒
 Lev 1:9,
⇒
 13; 
⇒
 Ezekiel 20:41)
applied to the Philippians' gift; cf 
⇒
 Eph 5:2;
⇒
 2 Cor 2:14-16.
11
 [21-23] On the usual greetings at
the conclusion of a letter, see the note on 
⇒
 1 Cor
16:19-24. Inclusion of greetings from all the holy ones in the place from
which Paul writes would involve even the Christians of
⇒
 Philippians 1:14-18 who had their differences with
Paul.
12
 [22] Those of Caesar's household:
minor officials or even slaves and freedmen, found in Ephesus or Rome, among
other places.
