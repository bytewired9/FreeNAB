[1]
 If there is any encouragement in Christ, any
solace in love, any participation in the Spirit, any compassion and mercy, 
2
complete my joy by being of the same mind, with
the same love, united in heart, thinking one thing. 
3
Do nothing out of selfishness or out of
vainglory; rather, humbly regard others as more important than yourselves, 
4
each looking out not for his own interests, but
(also) everyone for those of others. 
5
Have among yourselves the same attitude that is
also yours in Christ Jesus, 
[2]
6
Who, 
[3]
 though he was in the
form of God, did not regard equality with God something to be grasped. 
[4]
7
Rather, he emptied himself, taking the form of
a slave, coming in human likeness; 
[5]
 and found human in
appearance, 
8
he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death,
even death on a cross. 
[6]
9
Because of this, God greatly exalted him and
bestowed on him the name 
[7]
 that is above every name, 
10
that at the name of Jesus every knee should
bend, 
[8]
 of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
11
and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is
Lord, 
[9]
 to the glory of God the Father. 
12
[10]
[11]
 So then, my beloved, obedient
as you have always been, not only when I am present but all the more now when I
am absent, work out your salvation with fear and trembling. 
[12]
13
For God is the one who, for his good purpose,
works in you both to desire and to work. 
14
Do everything without grumbling or questioning,
15
that you may be blameless and innocent,
children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse
generation, 
[13]
 among whom you shine like lights in the
world, 
16
as you hold on to the word of life, so that my
boast for the day of Christ may be that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.
17
But, even if I am poured out as a libation 
[14]
upon the sacrificial service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with all
of you. 
18
In the same way you also should rejoice and
share your joy with me. 
19
[15]
 I hope, in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy 
[16]
to you soon, so that I too may be heartened by hearing news of you. 
20
For I have no one comparable to him for genuine
interest in whatever concerns you. 
21
For they all seek their own interests, not
those of Jesus Christ. 
22
But you know his worth, how as a child with a
father he served along with me in the cause of the gospel. 
23
He it is, then, whom I hope to send as soon as
I see how things go with me, 
24
but I am confident in the Lord that I myself
will also come soon. 
[17]
25
With regard to Epaphroditus, 
[18]
my brother and co-worker and fellow soldier, your messenger and minister in my need,
I consider it necessary to send him to you. 
26
For he has been longing for all of you and was
distressed because you heard that he was ill. 
27
He was indeed ill, close to death; but God had
mercy on him, not just on him but also on me, so that I might not have sorrow
upon sorrow. 
28
I send him therefore with the greater
eagerness, so that, on seeing him, you may rejoice again, and I may have less
anxiety. 
29
Welcome him then in the Lord with all joy and
hold such people in esteem, 
30
because for the sake of the work of Christ he
came close to death, risking his life to make up for those services to me that
you could not perform.

 [1-11] The admonition to
likemindedness and unity (
⇒
 Philippians 2:2-5) is
based on the believers' threefold experience with Christ, God's love, and the
Spirit. The appeal to humility (
⇒
 Philippians 2:3)
and to obedience (
⇒
 Philippians 2:12) is rooted in
christology, specifically in a statement about Christ Jesus
(
⇒
 Philippians 2:6-11) and his humbling of self and
obedience to the point of death (
⇒
 Philippians 2:8). 
2
 [5] Have . . . the same attitude
that is also yours in Christ Jesus: or, "that also Christ Jesus had."
While it is often held that Christ here functions as a model for moral
imitation, it is not the historical Jesus but the entire Christ event that
⇒
 Philippians 2:6-11 depict. Therefore, the appeal is
to have in relations among yourselves that same relationship you have in Jesus
Christ, i.e., serving one another as you serve Christ
(
⇒
 Philippians 2:4).
3
 [6-11] Perhaps an early Christian
hymn quoted here by Paul. The short rhythmic lines fall into two parts,
⇒
 Philippians 2:6-8 where the subject of every verb
is Christ, and 
⇒
 Philippians 2:9-11 where the subject
is God. The general pattern is thus of Christ's humiliation and then
exaltation. More precise analyses propose a division into six three-line
stanzas (
⇒
 Philippians 2:6,
⇒
 7abc, 
⇒
 7d-8,
9, 
⇒
 10,
⇒
 11) or into three stanzas
(
⇒
 Philippians 2:6-7ab,
⇒
 7cd-8, 
⇒
 9-11). Phrases
such as even death on a cross (
⇒
 Philippians 2:8c)
are considered by some to be additions (by Paul) to the hymn, as are
⇒
 Philippians 2:10c,
⇒
 11c.
4
 [6] Either a reference to Christ's
preexistence and those aspects of divinity that he was willing to give up in
order to serve in human form, or to what the man Jesus refused to grasp at to
attain divinity. Many see an allusion to the Genesis story: unlike Adam, Jesus,
though . . . in the form of God (
⇒
 Genesis 1:26-27),
did not reach out for equality with God, in contrast with the first Adam in
⇒
 Genesis 3:5-6.
5
 [7] Taking the form of a slave,
coming in human likeness: or ". . . taking the form of a slave. Coming in
human likeness, and found human in appearance." While it is common to take
⇒
 Philippians 2:6, 7 as
dealing with Christ's preexistence and 
⇒
2:8 with his incarnate life, so that lines
⇒
 Philippians 2:7b, 
⇒
 7c
are parallel, it is also possible to interpret so as to exclude any reference
to preexistence (see the note on 
⇒
 Philippians 2:6) and
to take 
⇒
 Philippians 2:6-8 as presenting two
parallel stanzas about Jesus' human state (
⇒
2:6-7b; 7cd-8); in the latter alternative, coming in human likeness
begins the second stanza and parallels 6a to some extent.
6
 [8] There may be reflected here
language about the servant of the Lord, 
⇒
 Isaiah
52:13-
⇒
 53:12 especially
⇒
 Isaiah 53:12.
7
 [9] The name: "Lord"
(
⇒
 Philippians 2:11), revealing the true nature of
the one who is named.
8
 [10-11] Every knee should bend . .
. every tongue confess: into this language of 
⇒
 Isaiah
45:23 there has been inserted a reference to the three levels in the
universe, according to ancient thought, heaven, earth, under the earth.
9
 [11] Jesus Christ is Lord: a common
early Christian acclamation; cf 
⇒
 1 Cor 12:3;
⇒
 Romans 10:9. But doxology to God the Father is not
overlooked here (
⇒
 Philippians 2:11c) in the final
version of the hymn.
10
 [12] Fear and trembling: a common
Old Testament expression indicating awe and seriousness in the service of God
(cf 
⇒
 Exodus 15:16; 
⇒
 Judith
2:28; 
⇒
 Psalm 2:11;
⇒
 Isaiah 19:16).
11
 [12-18] Paul goes on to draw out
further ethical implications for daily life (
⇒
2:14-18) from the salvation God works in Christ.
12
 [12] Fear and trembling: a common
Old Testament expression indicating awe and seriousness in the service of God
(cf 
⇒
 Exodus 15:16; 
⇒
 Judith
2:28; 
⇒
 Psalm 2:11;
⇒
 Isaiah 19:16).
13
 [15-16] Generation . . . as you
hold on to . . . : or ". . . generation. Among them shine like lights in
the world because you hold the word of life. . . ."
14
 [17] Libation: in ancient religious
ritual, the pouring out on the ground of a liquid offering as a sacrifice. Paul
means that he may be facing death.
15
[
⇒
 2:19-
⇒
 3:1] The plans
of Paul and his assistants for future travel are regularly a part of a Pauline letter
near its conclusion; cf 
⇒
 Romans 15:22-29;
⇒
 1 Cor 16:5-12.
16
 [19] Timothy: already known to the
Philippians (
⇒
 Acts 16:1-15; cf
⇒
 1 Cor 4:17;
⇒
 16:10).
17
 [24] I myself will also come soon:
cf 
⇒
 Philippians 1:19-25 for the significance of
this statement.
18
 [25] Epaphroditus: sent by the
Philippians as their messenger (literally, "apostle") to aid Paul in
his imprisonment, he had fallen seriously ill; Paul commends him as he sends
him back to Philippi.
