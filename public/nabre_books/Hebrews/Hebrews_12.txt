[1]
 Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great
a cloud of witnesses, let us rid ourselves of every burden and sin that clings
to us 
[2]
 and persevere in running the race that lies before
us 
2
while keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus, the
leader and perfecter of faith. For the sake of the joy that lay before him he
endured the cross, despising its shame, and has taken his seat at the right of
the throne of God. 
3
Consider how he endured such opposition from
sinners, in order that you may not grow weary and lose heart. 
4
In your struggle against sin you have not yet
resisted to the point of shedding blood. 
5
You have also forgotten the exhortation
addressed to you as sons: "My son, do not disdain the discipline of the
Lord or lose heart when reproved by him; 
6
for whom the Lord loves, he disciplines; he
scourges every son he acknowledges." 
7
Endure your trials as "discipline";
God treats you as sons. For what "son" is there whom his father does
not discipline? 
8
If you are without discipline, in which all
have shared, you are not sons but bastards. 
9
Besides this, we have had our earthly fathers
to discipline us, and we respected them. Should we not (then) submit all the
more to the Father of spirits and live? 
10
They disciplined us for a short time as seemed
right to them, but he does so for our benefit, in order that we may share his
holiness. 
11
At the time, all discipline seems a cause not
for joy but for pain, yet later it brings the peaceful fruit of righteousness
to those who are trained by it. 
12
So strengthen your drooping hands and your weak
knees. 
13
Make straight paths for your feet, that what is
lame may not be dislocated but healed. 
14
Strive for peace with everyone, and for that
holiness without which no one will see the Lord. 
15
[3]
 See to it that no one be deprived of the grace
of God, that no bitter root spring up and cause trouble, through which many may
become defiled, 
16
that no one be an immoral or profane person
like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal. 
17
For you know that later, when he wanted to
inherit his father's blessing, he was rejected because he found no opportunity
to change his mind, even though he sought the blessing with tears. 
18
[4]
 You have not approached that which could be
touched 
[5]
 and a blazing fire and gloomy darkness and storm 
19
and a trumpet blast and a voice speaking words
such that those who heard begged that no message be further addressed to them, 
20
for they could not bear to hear the command:
"If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned." 
21
Indeed, so fearful was the spectacle that Moses
said, "I am terrified and trembling." 
22
No, you have approached Mount Zion and the city
of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and countless angels in festal gathering,
23
and the assembly of the firstborn enrolled in
heaven, 
[6]
 and God the judge of all, and the spirits of the
just made perfect, 
24
and Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and
the sprinkled blood that speaks more eloquently 
[7]
 than that
of Abel. 
25
See that you do not reject the one who speaks.
For if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth,
how much more in our case if we turn away from the one who warns from heaven. 
26
His voice shook the earth at that time, but now
he has promised, "I will once more shake not only earth but heaven." 
27
That phrase, "once more," points to
(the) removal of shaken, created things, so that what is unshaken may remain. 
28
Therefore, we who are receiving the unshakable
kingdom should have gratitude, with which we should offer worship pleasing to
God in reverence and awe. 
29
For our God is a consuming fire.

 [1-13] Christian life is to be
inspired not only by the Old Testament men and women of faith
(
⇒
 Hebrews 12:1) but above all by Jesus. As the
architect of Christian faith, he had himself to endure the cross before
receiving the glory of his triumph (
⇒
 Hebrews 12:2).
Reflection on his sufferings should give his followers courage to continue the
struggle, if necessary even to the shedding of blood
(
⇒
 Hebrews 12:3-4). Christians should regard their
own sufferings as the affectionate correction of the Lord, who loves them as a
father loves his children.
2
 [1] That clings to us: the meaning
is uncertain, since the Greek word euperistatos, translated cling, occurs only
here. The papyrus P46 and one minuscule read euperispastos, "easily
distracting," which also makes good sense. 
3
 [15-17] Esau serves as an example
in two ways: his profane attitude illustrates the danger of apostasy, and his
inability to secure a blessing afterward illustrates the impossibility of
repenting after falling away (see 
⇒
 Hebrews 6:4-6).
4
 [18-29] As a final appeal for adherence
to Christian teaching, the two covenants, of Moses and of Christ, are compared.
The Mosaic covenant, the author argues, is shown to have originated in fear of
God and threats of divine punishment (
⇒
12:18-21). The covenant in Christ gives us direct access to God
(
⇒
 Hebrews 12:22), makes us members of the
Christian community, God's children, a sanctified people
(
⇒
 Hebrews 12:23), who have Jesus as mediator to
speak for us (
⇒
 Hebrews 12:24). Not to heed the
voice of the risen Christ is a graver sin than the rejection of the word of
Moses (
⇒
 Hebrews 12:25-26). Though Christians fall
away, God's kingdom in Christ will remain and his justice will punish those
guilty of deserting it (
⇒
 Hebrews 12:28-29).

 [18] This remarkably beautiful
passage contrasts two great assemblies of people: that of the Israelites
gathered at Mount Sinai for the sealing of the old covenant and the
promulgation of the Mosaic law, and that of the followers of Jesus gathered at
Mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, the assembly of the new covenant. This
latter scene, marked by the presence of countless angels and of Jesus with his
redeeming blood, is reminiscent of the celestial liturgies of the Book of
Revelation.
6
 [23] The assembly of the firstborn
enrolled in heaven: this expression may refer to the angels of
⇒
 Hebrews 12:22, or to the heroes of the Old
Testament (see Hebrews 11), or to the entire assembly of the new covenant.
7
 [24] Speaks more eloquently: the
blood of Abel, the first human blood to be shed, is contrasted with that of
Jesus. Abel's blood cried out from the earth for vengeance, but the blood of
Jesus has opened the way for everyone, providing cleansing and access to God
(
⇒
 Hebrews 10:19).
