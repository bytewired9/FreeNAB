[1]
 Let mutual love continue. 
2
Do not neglect hospitality, for through it some
have unknowingly entertained angels. 
3
Be mindful of prisoners as if sharing their
imprisonment, and of the ill-treated as of yourselves, for you also are in the
body. 
4
Let marriage be honored among all and the
marriage bed be kept undefiled, for God will judge the immoral and adulterers. 
5
Let your life be free from love of money but be
content with what you have, for he has said, "I will never forsake you or
abandon you." 
6
Thus we may say with confidence: "The Lord
is my helper, (and) I will not be afraid. What can anyone do to me?" 
7
Remember your leaders who spoke the word of God
to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. 
8
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
9
Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange
teaching. 
[2]
 It is good to have our hearts strengthened by
grace and not by foods, which do not benefit those who live by them. 
10
We have an altar 
[3]
 from
which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat. 
11
The bodies of the animals whose blood the high
priest brings into the sanctuary as a sin offering are burned outside the camp.
12
Therefore, Jesus also suffered outside the
gate, to consecrate the people by his own blood. 
13
Let us then go to him outside the camp, bearing
the reproach that he bore. 
14
For here we have no lasting city, but we seek
the one that is to come. 
15
Through him (then) let us continually offer God
a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips that confess his name. 
16
Do not neglect to do good and to share what you
have; God is pleased by sacrifices of that kind. 
17
[4]
 Obey your leaders and defer to them, for they
keep watch over you and will have to give an account, that they may fulfill
their task with joy and not with sorrow, for that would be of no advantage to
you. 
18
Pray for us, for we are confident that we have
a clear conscience, wishing to act rightly in every respect. 
19
I especially ask for your prayers that I may be
restored to you very soon. 
20
[5]
 May the God of peace, who brought up from the
dead the great shepherd of the sheep by the blood of the eternal covenant,
Jesus our Lord, 
21
furnish you with all that is good, that you may
do his will. May he carry out in you what is pleasing to him through Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory forever (and ever). Amen. 
22
Brothers, I ask you to bear with this message
of encouragement, for I have written to you rather briefly. 
23
I must let you know that our brother Timothy
has been set free. If he comes soon, I shall see you together with him. 
24
Greetings to all your leaders and to all the
holy ones. Those from Italy send you greetings. 
25
Grace be with all of you.

 [1-16] After recommendations on
social and moral matters (
⇒
 Hebrews 13:1-6), the
letter turns to doctrinal issues. The fact that the original leaders are dead
should not cause the recipients of this letter to lose their faith
(
⇒
 Hebrews 13:7), for Christ still lives and he
remains always the same (
⇒
 Hebrews 13:8). They must
not rely for their personal sanctification on regulations concerning foods
(
⇒
 Hebrews 13:9), nor should they entertain the
notion that Judaism and Christianity can be intermingled
(
⇒
 Hebrews 13:10; cf the notes on
⇒
 Gal 2:11-14;
⇒
 2:15-21). As Jesus died separated from his own
people, so must the Christian community remain apart from the religious
doctrines of Judaism (
⇒
 Hebrews 13:11-14). Christ
must be the heart and center of the community (
⇒
13:15-16). 
2
 [9] Strange teaching: this doctrine
about foods probably refers to the Jewish food laws; in view of
⇒
 Hebrews 13:10, however, the author may be
thinking of the Mosaic sacrificial banquets.
3
 [10] We have an altar: this does
not refer to the Eucharist, which is never clearly mentioned in Hebrews, but to
the sacrifice of Christ.
4
 [17-25] Recommending obedience to
the leaders of the community, the author asks for prayers
(
⇒
 Hebrews 13:17-19). The letter concludes with a
blessing (
⇒
 Hebrews 13:20-21), a final request for
the acceptance of its message (
⇒
 Hebrews 13:22),
information regarding Timothy (
⇒
 Hebrews 13:23),
and general greetings (
⇒
 Hebrews 13:24-25).

 [20-21] These verses constitute one
of the most beautiful blessings in the New Testament. The resurrection of Jesus
is presupposed throughout Hebrews, since it is included in the author's frequently
expressed idea of his exaltation, but this is the only place where it is
explicitly mentioned.
