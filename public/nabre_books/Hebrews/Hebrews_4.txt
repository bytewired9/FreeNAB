Therefore, let us be on our guard while the
promise of entering into his rest remains, that none of you seem to have
failed. 
2
For in fact we have received the good news just
as they did. But the word that they heard did not profit them, for they were not
united in faith with those who listened. 
3
For we who believed enter into (that) rest,
just as he has said: "As I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter into
my rest,'" and yet his works were accomplished at the foundation of the
world. 
4
For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh
day in this manner, "And God rested on the seventh day from all his
works"; 
5
and again, in the previously mentioned place,
"They shall not enter into my rest." 
6
Therefore, since it remains that some will
enter into it, and those who formerly received the good news did not enter
because of disobedience, 
7
he once more set a day, "today," when
long afterwards he spoke through David, as already quoted: "Oh, that today
you would hear his voice: 'Harden not your hearts.'" 
8
Now if Joshua had given them rest, he would not
have spoken afterwards of another day. 
9
Therefore, a sabbath rest still remains for the
people of God. 
10
And whoever enters into God's rest, rests from
his own works as God did from his. 
11
Therefore, let us strive to enter into that
rest, so that no one may fall after the same example of disobedience. 
12
Indeed, the word of God is living and
effective, sharper than any two-edged sword, penetrating even between soul and
spirit, joints and marrow, and able to discern reflections and thoughts of the
heart. 
13
No creature is concealed from him, but
everything is naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must render an
account. 
14
[1]
 Therefore, since we have a great high priest
who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to
our confession. 
15
For we do not have a high priest who is unable
to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has similarly been tested in
every way, yet without sin. 
16
So let us confidently approach the throne of
grace to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help.

 [14-16] These verses, which return
to the theme first sounded in 
⇒
2:16-
⇒
 3:1, serve as an introduction to the
section that follows. The author here alone calls Jesus a great high priest
(
⇒
 Hebrews 4:14), a designation used by Philo for
the Logos; perhaps he does so in order to emphasize Jesus' superiority over the
Jewish high priest. He has been tested in every way, yet without sin
(
⇒
 Hebrews 4:15); this indicates an acquaintance
with the tradition of Jesus' temptations, not only at the beginning (as in
⇒
 Mark 1:13) but throughout his public life (cf
⇒
 Luke 22:28). Although the reign of the exalted
Jesus is a theme that occurs elsewhere in Hebrews, and Jesus' throne is
mentioned in 
⇒
 Hebrews 1:8, the throne of grace
(
⇒
 Hebrews 4:16) refers to the throne of God. The
similarity of 
⇒
 Hebrews 4:16 to
⇒
 Hebrews 10:19-22 indicates that the author is
thinking of our confident access to God, made possible by the priestly work of
Jesus.
