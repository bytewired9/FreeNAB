Isaac therefore called Jacob, greeted him with
a blessing, and charged him: "You shall not marry a Canaanite woman! 
2
Go now to Paddan-aram, to the home of your
mother's father Bethuel, and there choose a wife for yourself from among the
daughters of your uncle Laban. 
3
May God Almighty bless you and make you
fertile, multiply you that you may become an assembly of peoples. 
4
May he extend to you and your descendants the
blessing he gave to Abraham, so that you may gain possession of the land where
you are staying, which he assigned to Abraham." 
5
Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way; he went to
Paddan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, and brother of Rebekah, the
mother of Jacob and Esau. 
6
Esau noted that Isaac had blessed Jacob when he
sent him to Paddan-aram to get himself a wife there, charging him, as he gave
him his blessing, not to marry a Canaanite woman, 
7
and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother
and gone to Paddan-aram. 
8
Esau realized how displeasing the Canaanite
women were to his father Isaac, 
9
so he went to Ishmael, and in addition to the
wives he had, married Mahalath, the daughter of Abraham's son Ishmael and
sister of Nebaioth. 
10
Jacob departed from Beer-sheba and proceeded
toward Haran. 
11
[1]
 When he came upon a certain shrine, as the sun
had already set, he stopped there for the night. Taking one of the stones at
the shrine, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep at that spot. 
12
[2]
 Then he had a dream: a stairway rested on the
ground, with its top reaching to the heavens; and God's messengers were going
up and down on it. 
13
And there was the LORD standing beside him and
saying: "I, the LORD, am the God of your forefather Abraham and the God of
Isaac; the land on which you are lying I will give to you and your descendants.
14
These shall be as plentiful as the dust of the
earth, and through them you shall spread out east and west, north and south. In
you and your descendants all the nations of the earth shall find blessing. 
15
Know that I am with you; I will protect you
wherever you go, and bring you back to this land. I will never leave you until
I have done what I promised you." 
16
When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he exclaimed,
"Truly, the LORD is in this spot, although I did not know it!" 
17
[3]
 In solemn wonder he cried out: "How
awesome is this shrine! This is nothing else but an abode of God, and that is
the gateway to heaven!" 
18
[4]
 Early the next morning Jacob took the stone
that he had put under his head, set it up as a memorial stone, and poured oil
on top of it. 
19
[5]
 He called that site Bethel, whereas the former
name of the town had been Luz. 
20
Jacob then made this vow: "If God remains
with me, to protect me on this journey I am making and to give me enough bread
to eat and clothing to wear, 
21
and I come back safe to my father's house, the
LORD shall be my God. 
22
This stone that I have set up as a memorial
stone shall be God's abode. Of everything you give me, I will faithfully return
a tenth part to you." 
1
 [11] Shrine: literally "place,"
often used specifically of a sacred site. Here the place was Bethel
(
⇒
 Genesis 28:19), a sacred site as early as the
time of Abraham (
⇒
 Genesis 12:8).
2
 [12] Stairway: in Hebrew, sullam, traditionally
but inaccurately translated as "ladder." The corresponding verb,
salal, means "to heap up" something, such as dirt for a highway or
ramp. The imagery in Jacob's dream is derived from the Babylonian ziggurat or
temple tower, "with its top in the sky" (
⇒
11:4), and with brick steps leading up to a small temple at the top.
3
 [17] This: the stone Jacob used as
a headrest; cf 
⇒
 Genesis 28:22. That: the stairway
Jacob saw in his dream.
4
 [18] Memorial stone: in Hebrew,
masseba, a stone which might vary in shape and size, set upright and usually
intended for some religious purpose. Since the custom of erecting such
"sacred pillars" in Palestine went back to its pre-Israelite period,
their pagan associations were often retained; therefore, later Israelite
religion forbade their erection (
⇒
 Lev 26:1;
⇒
 Deut 16:22) and ordered the destruction of those
that were associated with paganism (
⇒
 Exodus 34:31;
⇒
 Deut 12:3).
5
 [19] Bethel: i.e., "house of
God"; the reference is to the abode of God in 
⇒
28:17.
