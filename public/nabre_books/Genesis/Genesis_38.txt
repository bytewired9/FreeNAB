[1]
 About that time Judah parted from his brothers
and pitched his tent near a certain Adullamite named Hirah. 
2
There he met the daughter of a Canaanite named
Shua, married her, and had relations with her. 
3
She conceived and bore a son, whom she named
Er. 
4
Again she conceived and bore a son, whom she
named Onan. 
5
[2]
 Then she bore still another son, whom she
named Shelah. They were in Chezib when he was born. 
6
Judah got a wife named Tamar for his
first-born, Er. 
7
But Er, Judah's first-born, greatly offended
the LORD; so the LORD took his life. 
8
[3]
 Then Judah said to Onan, "Unite with your
brother's widow, in fulfillment of your duty as brother-in-law, and thus
preserve your brother's line." 
9
Onan, however, knew that the descendants would
not be counted as his; so whenever he had relations with his brother's widow,
he wasted his seed on the ground, to avoid contributing offspring for his
brother. 
10
What he did greatly offended the LORD, and the
LORD took his life too. 
11
Thereupon Judah said to his daughter-in-law
Tamar, "Stay as a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows
up" - for he feared that Shelah also might die like his brothers. So Tamar
went to live in her father's house. 
12
Years passed, and Judah's wife, the daughter of
Shua, died. After Judah completed the period of mourning, he went up to Timnah
for the shearing of his sheep, in company with his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
13
When Tamar was told that her father-in-law was
on his way up to Timnah to shear his sheep, 
14
she took off her widow's garb, veiled her face
by covering herself with a shawl, and sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which
is on the way to Timnah; for she was aware that, although Shelah was now grown
up, she had not been given to him in marriage. 
15
When Judah saw her, he mistook her for a
harlot, since she had covered her face. 
16
So he went over to her at the roadside, and not
realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he said, "Come, let me have
intercourse with you." She replied, "What will you pay me for letting
you have intercourse with me?" 
17
He answered, "I will send you a kid from
the flock." "Very well," she said, "provided you leave a
pledge until you send it." 
18
[4]
 Judah asked, "What pledge am I to give to
you?" She answered, "Your seal and cord, and the staff you
carry." So he gave them to her and had intercourse with her, and she
conceived by him. 
19
When she went away, she took off her shawl and
put on her widow's garb again. 
20
Judah sent the kid by his friend the Adullamite
to recover the pledge from the woman; but he could not find her. 
21
[5]
 So he asked the men of the place, "Where
is the temple prostitute, the one by the roadside in Enaim?" But they answered,
"There has never been a temple prostitute here." 
22
He went back to Judah and told him, "I
could not find her; and besides, the men of the place said there was no temple
prostitute there." 
23
"Let her keep the things," Judah
replied; "otherwise we shall become a laughingstock. After all, I did send
her the kid, even though you were unable to find her." 
24
About three months later, Judah was told that
his daughter-in-law Tamar had played the harlot and was then with child from
her harlotry. "Bring her out," cried Judah; "she shall be
burned." 
25
But as they were bringing her out, she sent
word to her father-in-law, "It is by the man to whom these things belong
that I am with child. Please verify," she added, "whose seal and cord
and whose staff these are." 
26
Judah recognized them and said, "She is
more in the right than I am, since I did not give her to my son Shelah."
But he had no further relations with her. 
27
When the time of her delivery came, she was
found to have twins in her womb. 
28
While she was giving birth, one infant put out
his hand; and the midwife, taking a crimson thread, tied it on his hand, to
note that this one came out first. 
29
[6]
 But as he withdrew his hand, his brother came
out; and she said, "What a breach you have made for yourself!" So he
was called Perez. 
30
[7]
 Afterward his brother came out; he was called
Zerah.

 [1-30] This chapter, from the
Yahwist source, has nothing to do with the Joseph story in which Judah is still
living with his father and brothers. The sacred author inserted this independent
account from the life of Judah at this place to mark the long lapse of time
during which Joseph's family knew nothing of his life in Egypt. This is
apparently a personalized history of the early days of the tribe of Judah,
which interbred with several Canaanite clans, though some of these soon became
extinct.

Achzib (

 Joshua 15:44;

 Micah
1:14), a town in the Judean Shephelah.

 [8] Preserve your brother's line:
literally "raise up seed for your brother." The ancient Israelites
regarded as very important their law of levirate, or "brother-in-law"
marriage; see notes on 
⇒
 Deut 25:5; 
⇒
 Ruth
2:20. In the present story, it is primarily Onan's violation of this
law, rather than the means he used to circumvent it, that brought on him God's
displeasure (
⇒
 Genesis 38:9-10).

 [18] Seal and cord: the cylinder
seal, through which a hole was bored lengthwise so that it could be worn from
the neck by a cord, was a distinctive means of identification. Apparently a
man's staff was also marked with his name (
⇒
 Numbers
17:16-17) or other sign of identification.

 [21] Temple prostitute: the Hebrew
term qedesha, literally "consecrated woman," designates a woman who
had ritual intercourse with men in pagan fertility rites; cf
⇒
 Deut 23:18; 
⇒
 Hosea
4:14, where the same Hebrew word is used. Hirah the Adullamite uses a
word that refers to a higher social class than that designated by the term
zona, common "harlot," used in 
⇒
38:15-24.
6
 [29] He was called Perez: the
Hebrew word means "breach."
7
 [30] He was called Zerah: a name
connected here by popular etymology with a Hebrew verb for the red light of
dawn, alluding apparently to the crimson thread.
