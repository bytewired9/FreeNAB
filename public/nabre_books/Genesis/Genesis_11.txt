[1]
 The whole world spoke the same language, using
the same words. 
2
[2]
 While men were migrating in the east, they
came upon a valley in the land of Shinar and settled there. 
3
They said to one another, "Come, let us
mold bricks and harden them with fire." They used bricks for stone, and
bitumen for mortar. 
4
[3]
 Then they said, "Come, let us build
ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the sky, and so make a name for
ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered all over the earth." 
5
LORD came down to see the city and the tower
that the men had built. 
6
Then the LORD said: "If now, while they
are one people, all speaking the same language, they have started to do this,
nothing will later stop them from doing whatever they presume to do. 
7
Let us then go down and there confuse their
language, so that one will not understand what another says." 
8
Thus the LORD scattered them from there all
over the earth, and they stopped building the city. 
9
[4]
 That is why it was called Babel, because there
the LORD confused the speech of all the world. It was from that place that he
scattered them all over the earth. 
10
[5]
 This is the record of the descendants of Shem.
When Shem was one hundred years old, he became the father of Arpachshad, two
years after the flood. 
11
Shem lived five hundred years after the birth
of Arpachshad, and he had other sons and daughters. 
12
[6]
 When Arpachshad was thirty-five years old, he became
the father of Shelah. 
13
Arpachshad lived four hundred and three years
after the birth of Shelah, and he had other sons and daughters. 
14
When Shelah was thirty years old, he became the
father of Eber. 
15
Shelah lived four hundred and three years after
the birth of Eber, and he had other sons and daughters. 
16
[7]
 When Eber was thirty-four years old, he became
the father of Peleg. 
17
Eber lived four hundred and thirty years after
the birth of Peleg, and he had other sons and daughters. 
18
When Peleg was thirty years old, he became the
father of Reu. 
19
Peleg lived two hundred and nine years after
the birth of Reu, and he had other sons and daughters. 
20
When Reu was thirty-two years old, he became
the father of Serug. 
21
Reu lived two hundred and seven years after the
birth of Serug, and he had other sons and daughters. 
22
When Serug was thirty years old, he became the
father of Nahor. 
23
Serug lived two hundred years after the birth
of Nahor, and he had other sons and daughters. 
24
When Nahor was twenty-nine years old, he became
the father of Terah. 
25
Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years
after the birth of Terah, and he had other sons and daughters. 
26
When Terah was seventy years old, he became the
father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. 
27
This is the record of the descendants of Terah.
Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and Haran became the father
of Lot. 
28
[8]
 Haran died before his father Terah, in his
native land, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 
29
Abram and Nahor took wives; the name of Abram's
wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah, daughter of Haran, the
father of Milcah and Iscah. 
30
Sarai was barren; she had no child. 
31
[9]
 Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot,
son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and
brought them out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to go to the land of Canaan. But when
they reached Haran, they settled there. 
32
[10]
 The lifetime of Terah was two hundred and five
years; then Terah died in Haran.

 [1-9] This story, based on
traditions about the temple towers or ziggurats of Babylonia, is used by the
sacred writer primarily to illustrate man's increasing wickedness, shown here in
his presumptuous effort to create an urban culture apart from God. The
secondary motive in the story is to present an imaginative origin of the
diversity of the languages among the various peoples inhabiting the earth, as
well as an artificial explanation of the name "Babylon."
2
 [2] Shinar: see note on
⇒
 Genesis 10:10.
3
 [4] Tower with its top in the sky:
a direct reference to the chief ziggurat of Babylon, the E-sag-ila, signifying
"the house that raises high its head." Babylonian ziggurats were the
earliest skyscrapers.
4
 [9] Babel: the Hebrew form of the
name "Babylon"; the native name, Bab-ili, means "gate of the
gods." The Hebrew word balil, "he confused," has a similar
sound. Apparently the name referred originally only to a certain part of the
city, the district near the gate that led to the temple area.
5
 [10-26] This section is a
continuation of the genealogical record given in 
⇒
5:1-32; see note there. Although the ages of the patriarchs in this
list are much lower than those of the antediluvian patriarchs, they are still
artificial and devoid of historical value. The ages given here are from the
current Hebrew text; the Samaritan and Greek texts have divergent sets of
numbers in most cases.
6
 [12] The Greek text has a certain
Kenan (cf 
⇒
 Genesis 5:9-10) between Arpachshad and
Shelah. This text is followed in 
⇒
 Luke 3:36.
7
 [16] Eber: the eponymous ancestor
of the Hebrews, "descendants of Eber" (
⇒
10:21, 
⇒
 24-30); see note on
⇒
 Genesis 14:13.
8
 [28] Ur of the Chaldeans: Ur was an
extremely ancient city of the Sumerians (later, of the Babylonians) in southern
Mesopotamia. The Greek text has "the land of the Chaldeans." In
either case, the term Chaldeans is an anachronism, because the Chaldeans were
not known to history until approximately a thousand years after Abraham's time.
9
 [31] The Samaritan and Greek texts
include Nahor and his wife in Terah's migration to Haran. Although this is
probably due to scribal harmonization, Nahor's family actually did migrate to
Haran; cf 
⇒
 Genesis 24:10;
⇒
 27:43.
10
 [32] Since Terah was seventy years
old when his son Abraham was born (
⇒
11:26), and Abraham was seventy-five when he left Haran
(
⇒
 Genesis 12:4), Terah lived in Haran for sixty
years after Abraham's departure. According to the tradition in the Samaritan
text, Terah died when he was one hundred and forty-five years old, therefore,
in the same year in which Abraham left Haran. This is the tradition followed in
St. Stephen's speech: Abraham left Haran "after his father's death"
(
⇒
 Acts 7:4).
