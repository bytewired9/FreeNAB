Early the next morning, Laban kissed his
grandchildren and his daughters goodbye; then he set out on his journey back
home, 
2
while Jacob continued on his own way. Then
God's messengers encountered Jacob. 
3
[1]
 When he saw them he said, "This is God's
encampment." So he named that place Mahanaim. 
4
Jacob sent messengers ahead to his brother Esau
in the land of Seir, the country of Edom, 
5
with this message: "Thus shall you say to
my lord Esau: 'Your servant Jacob speaks as follows: I have been staying with
Laban and have been detained there until now. 
6
I own cattle, asses and sheep, as well as male
and female servants. I am sending my lord this information in the hope of
gaining your favor.'" 
7
When the messengers returned to Jacob, they
said, "We reached your brother Esau. He is now coming to meet you,
accompanied by four hundred men." 
8
Jacob was very much frightened. In his anxiety,
he divided the people who were with him, as well as his flocks, herds and camels,
into two camps. 
9
"If Esau should attack and overwhelm one
camp," he reasoned, "the remaining camp may still survive." 
10
Then he prayed: "O God of my father
Abraham and God of my father Isaac! You told me, O LORD, 'Go back to the land
of your birth, and I will be good to you.' 
11
I am unworthy of all the acts of kindness that
you have loyally performed for your servant: although I crossed the Jordan here
with nothing but my staff, I have now grown into two companies. 
12
Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother
Esau! Otherwise I fear that when he comes he will strike me down and slay the
mothers and children. 
13
You yourself said, 'I will be very good to you,
and I will make your descendants like the sands of the sea, which are too
numerous to count.'" 
14
After passing the night there, Jacob selected
from what he had with him the following presents for his brother Esau: 
15
two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats; two
hundred ewes and twenty rams; 
16
thirty milch camels and their young; forty cows
and ten bulls; twenty she-asses and ten he-asses. 
17
He put these animals in charge of his servants,
in separate droves, and he told the servants, "Go on ahead of me, but keep
a space between one drove and the next." 
18
To the servant in the lead he gave this
instruction: "When my brother Esau meets you, he may ask you, 'Whose man
are you? Where are you going? To whom do these animals ahead of you belong?' 
19
Then you shall answer, 'They belong to your
brother Jacob, but they have been sent as a gift to my lord Esau; and Jacob
himself is right behind us.'" 
20
He gave similar instructions to the second
servant and the third and to all the others who followed behind the droves,
namely: "Thus and thus shall you say to Esau, when you reach him; 
21
and be sure to add, 'Your servant Jacob is
right behind us.'" For Jacob reasoned, "If I first appease him with
gifts that precede me, then later, when I face him, perhaps he will forgive
me." 
22
So the gifts went on ahead of him, while he
stayed that night in the camp. 
23
In the course of that night, however, Jacob
arose, took his two wives, with the two maidservants and his eleven children,
and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. 
24
After he had taken them across the stream and
had brought over all his possessions, 
25
[2]
 Jacob was left there alone. Then some man
wrestled with him until the break of dawn. 
26
When the man saw that he could not prevail over
him, he struck Jacob's hip at its socket, so that the hip socket was wrenched
as they wrestled. 
27
The man then said, "Let me go, for it is
daybreak." But Jacob said, "I will not let you go until you bless
me." 
28
"What is your name?" the man asked.
He answered, "Jacob." 
29
[3]
 Then the man said, "You shall no longer
be spoken of as Jacob, but as Israel, because you have contended with divine
and human beings and have prevailed." 
30
Jacob then asked him, "Do tell me your
name, please." He answered, "Why should you want to know my
name?" With that, he bade him farewell. 
31
[4]
 Jacob named the place Peniel, "Because I
have seen God face to face," he said, "yet my life has been
spared." 
32
At sunrise, as he left Penuel, Jacob limped
along because of his hip. 
33
That is why, to this day, the Israelites do not
eat the sciatic muscle that is on the hip socket, inasmuch as Jacob's hip
socket was struck at the sciatic muscle.

 Israel: the first part of the

"you contended"; the second part is the first syllable of elohim,
"divine beings." The present incident, with a similar allusion to the
name Israel, is referred to in

 Hosea 12:5, where
the mysterious wrestler is explicitly called an angel.
