[1]
 The man had relations with his wife Eve, and
she conceived and bore Cain, saying, "I have produced a man with the help
of the LORD." 
2
Next she bore his brother Abel. Abel became a
keeper of flocks, and Cain a tiller of the soil. 
3
In the course of time Cain brought an offering
to the LORD from the fruit of the soil, 
4
while Abel, for his part, brought one of the
best firstlings of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his
offering, 
5
but on Cain and his offering he did not. Cain
greatly resented this and was crestfallen. 
6
So the LORD said to Cain: "Why are you so
resentful and crestfallen? 
7
[2]
 If you do well, you can hold up your head; but
if not, sin is a demon lurking at the door: his urge is toward you, yet you can
be his master." 
8
Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let us go
out in the field." When they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother
Abel and killed him. 
9
Then the LORD asked Cain, "Where is your
brother Abel?" He answered, "I do not know. Am I my brother's
keeper?" 
10
The LORD then said: "What have you done!
Listen: your brother's blood cries out to me from the soil! 
11
Therefore you shall be banned from the soil
that opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. 
12
If you till the soil, it shall no longer give
you its produce. You shall become a restless wanderer on the earth." 
13
Cain said to the LORD: "My punishment is
too great to bear. 
14
Since you have now banished me from the soil,
and I must avoid your presence and become a restless wanderer on the earth,
anyone may kill me at sight." 
15
[3]
 Not so!" the LORD said to him. "If
anyone kills Cain, Cain shall be avenged sevenfold." So the LORD put a
mark on Cain, lest anyone should kill him at sight. 
16
[4]
 Cain then left the LORD'S presence and settled
in the land of Nod, east of Eden. 
17
[5]
 Cain had relations with his wife, and she
conceived and bore Enoch. Cain also became the founder of a city, which he
named after his son Enoch. 
18
To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad became the
father of Mehujael; Mehujael became the father of Methusael, and Methusael
became the father of Lamech. 
19
Lamech took two wives; the name of the first
was Adah, and the name of the second Zillah. 
20
Adah gave birth to Jabal, the ancestor of all
who dwell in tents and keep cattle. 
21
His brother's name was Jubal; he was the
ancestor of all who play the lyre and the pipe. 
22
Zillah, on her part, gave birth to Tubalcain,
the ancestor of all who forge instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of
Tubalcain was Naamah. 
23
Lamech said to his wives: "Adah and
Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lamech, listen to my utterance: I have killed a
man for wounding me, a boy for bruising me. 
24
If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech
seventy-sevenfold." 
25
[6]
 Adam again had relations with his wife, and
she gave birth to a son whom she called Seth. "God has granted me more
offspring in place of Abel," she said, "because Cain slew him." 
26
To Seth, in turn, a son was born, and he named
him Enosh. At that time men began to invoke the LORD by name. 
1
 [1] The Hebrew name qayin
("Cain") and the term qaniti ("I have produced") present
another play on words. 
2
 [7] Demon lurking: in Hebrew,
robes, literally "croucher," is used here, like the similar Akkadian
term rabisu, to designate a certain kind of evil spirit.
3
 [15] A mark: probably a tattoo. The
use of tattooing for tribal marks has always been common among the nomads of
the Near Eastern deserts.
4
 [16] The land of Nod: not a
definite geographic region. The term merely means "the land of
nomads."
5
 [17-22] In
⇒
 Genesis 4:12-16 Cain was presented as the
archetype of nomadic peoples. The sacred author in this section follows another
ancient tradition that makes Cain the prototype of sedentary peoples with
higher material culture.
6
 [25-26] Has granted: Hebrew shat, a
wordplay on the name shet ("Seth"). Enosh: in Hebrew, a synonym of
adam ("man"). At the time . . . name: men began to call God by his
personal name, Yahweh, rendered as "the LORD" in this version of the
Bible. The ancient, so-called Yahwist source used here employs the name Yahweh
long before the time of Moses. Another ancient source, the Elohist (from its
use of the term Elohim, "God," instead of Yahweh, "Lord,"
for the pre-Mosaic period), makes Moses the first to use Yahweh as the proper
name of Israel's God, previously known by other names as well; cf

 Exodus 3:13-15.
