[1]
 After Jacob resumed his journey, he came to
the land of the Easterners. 
2
Looking about, he saw a well in the open
country, with three droves of sheep huddled near it, for droves were watered
from that well. A large stone covered the mouth of the well. 
3
Only when all the shepherds were assembled
there could they roll the stone away from the mouth of the well and water the
flocks. Then they would put the stone back again over the mouth of the well. 
4
Jacob said to them, "Friends, where are
you from?" "We are from Haran," they replied. 
5
Then he asked them, "Do you know Laban,
son of Nahor?" "We do," they answered. 
6
He inquired further, "Is he well?"
"He is," they answered; "and here comes his daughter Rachel with
his flock." 
7
Then he said: "There is still much
daylight left; it is hardly the time to bring the animals home. Why don't you
water the flocks now, and then continue pasturing them?" 
8
"We cannot," they replied,
"until all the shepherds are here to roll the stone away from the mouth of
the well; only then can we water the flocks." 
9
While he was still talking with them, Rachel
arrived with her father's sheep; she was the one who tended them. 
10
As soon as Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of
his uncle Laban, with the sheep of his uncle Laban, he went up, rolled the
stone away from the mouth of the well, and watered his uncle's sheep. 
11
[2]
 Then Jacob kissed Rachel and burst into tears.
12
He told her that he was her father's relative,
Rebekah's son, and she ran to tell her father. 
13
When Laban heard the news about his sister's
son Jacob, he hurried out to meet him. After embracing and kissing him, he
brought him to his house. Jacob then recounted to Laban all that had happened, 
14
[3]
 and Laban said to him, "You are indeed my
flesh and blood." After Jacob had stayed with him a full month, 
15
Laban said to him: "Should you serve me
for nothing just because you are a relative of mine? Tell me what your wages
should be." 
16
Now Laban had two daughters; the older was
called Leah, the younger Rachel. 
17
[4]
 Leah had lovely eyes, but Rachel was well
formed and beautiful. 
18
[5]
 Since Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel, he
answered Laban, "I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter
Rachel." 
19
Laban replied, "I prefer to give her to
you rather than to an outsider. Stay with me." 
20
So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, yet
they seemed to him but a few days because of his love for her. 
21
Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my
wife, that I may consummate my marriage with her, for my term is now
completed." 
22
So Laban invited all the local inhabitants and
gave a feast. 
23
At nightfall he took his daughter Leah and
brought her to Jacob, and Jacob consummated the marriage with her. 
24
(Laban assigned his slave girl Zilpah to his
daughter Leah as her maidservant.) 
25
[6]
 In the morning Jacob was amazed: it was Leah!
So he cried out to Laban: "How could you do this to me! Was it not for
Rachel that I served you? Why did you dupe me?" 
26
"It is not the custom in our
country," Laban replied, "to marry off a younger daughter before an
older one. 
27
[7]
 Finish the bridal week for this one, and then
I will give you the other too, in return for another seven years of service
with me." 
28
Jacob agreed. He finished the bridal week for
Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel in marriage. 
29
(Laban assigned his slave girl Bilhah to his
daughter Rachel as her maidservant.) 
30
Jacob then consummated his marriage with Rachel
also, and he loved her more than Leah. Thus he remained in Laban's service
another seven years. 
31
When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, he
made her fruitful, while Rachel remained barren. 
32
[8]
 Leah conceived and bore a son, and she named
him Reuben; for she said, "It means, 'The LORD saw my misery; now my
husband will love me.'" 
33
[9]
 She conceived again and bore a son, and said,
"It means, 'The LORD heard that I was unloved,' and therefore he has given
me this one also"; so she named him Simeon. 
34
[10]
 Again she conceived and bore a son, and she
said, "Now at last my husband will become attached to me, since I have now
borne him three sons"; that is why she named him Levi. 
35
[11]
 Once more she conceived and bore a son, and
she said, "This time I will give grateful praise to the LORD";
therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing children.

2
 [11] Burst into tears: literally
"raised his voice and wept," i.e., for joy.
3
 [14] Flesh and blood: literally
"bone and flesh," i.e., a close relative; on the Hebrew idiom, see

 Genesis 2:23.

 [17] Lovely eyes: the adjective
modifying eyes is often translated as "weak," but "lovely"
is the more probable word.

 [18] Jacob offers to render service
(

 Joshua 15:16,

bridal price (

 [25] Jacob was amazed: he had not
recognized Leah because a bride was veiled when she was brought to her
bridegroom; cf

 Genesis 24:65

 [27] The bridal week: an ancient
wedding lasted for seven days of festivities; cf

 Judges
14:12.

 [32] Reuben: the literal meaning of
the Hebrew name is "look, a son!" But in this case, as also with the
names of all the other sons of Jacob, a symbolic rather than an etymological
interpretation of the name is given, because the name and the persons were
regarded as closely interrelated. The symbolic interpretation of Reuben's name,
according to the Yahwist source, is based on the similar-sounding raa beonyi,
"he saw my misery." In the Elohist source, the name is explained by
the similar-sounding yeehabani, "he will love me."

 [33] Simeon: in popular etymology,
related to shama, "he heard."
10
 [34] Levi: related to yillaweh,
"he will become attached."

 [35] Judah: related to odeh,
"I will give grateful praise."
