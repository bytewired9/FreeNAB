 This is the message that the prophet Jeremiah
gave to Baruch, son of Neriah, when he wrote in a book the prophecies that
Jeremiah dictated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of
Judah: 
2
Thus says the LORD, God of Israel, to you,
Baruch, 
3
because you said, "Alas! the LORD adds
grief to my pain; I am weary from groaning, and can find no rest": 
4
say this to him, says the LORD: What I have
built, I am tearing down; what I have planted, I am uprooting: even the whole
land. 
5
And do you seek great things for yourself? Seek
them not! I am bringing evil on all mankind, says the LORD, but your life I
will leave you as booty, wherever you may go.

 [1-5] At the conclusion of his
narrative, Baruch appends a prophecy given him personally by Jeremiah when he
first wrote down Jeremiah's words (cf Jer 36). The future revealed by the
prophet had depressed Baruch; this prophecy was to assure him of his personal
safety, while repeating the Lord's determination to destroy Judah.
