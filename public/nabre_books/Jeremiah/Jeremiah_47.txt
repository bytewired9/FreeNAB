This is the word that came from the LORD to the
prophet Jeremiah concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh attacked Gaza: 
2
[1]
 Thus says the LORD: Behold: waters are rising
from the north, a torrent in flood; It shall flood the land and all that is in
it, the cities and their people. All the people of the land set up a wailing
cry. 
3
They hear the stamping hooves of his steeds,
the rattling chariots, the rumbling wheels. Fathers turn not to save their
children; their hands fall helpless 
4
[2]
 Because of the day which has come to ruin all
the Philistines, And cut off from Tyre and Sidon the last of their allies. Yes,
the LORD is destroying the Philistines, the remnant from the coasts of Caphtor.
5
[3]
 Gaza is shaved bald, Ashkelon is reduced to
silence; Ashdod, the remnant of their strength, how long will you gash
yourself? 
6
[4]
 Alas, sword of the LORD! how long till you
find rest? Return into your scabbard; stop, be still! 
7
How can it find rest when the LORD has
commanded it? Against Ashkelon and the seashore he has appointed it.

cities associated commercially with the Philistines, and enemies of
