[1]
 This word of the LORD came to me: 
2
[2]
 Go, cry out this message for Jerusalem to
hear! I remember the devotion of your youth, how you loved me as a bride,
Following me in the desert, in a land unsown. 
3
[3]
 Sacred to the LORD was Israel, the first
fruits of his harvest; Should anyone presume to partake of them, evil would
befall him, says the LORD. 
4
Listen to the word of the LORD, O house of
Jacob! All you clans of the house of Israel, 
5
thus says the LORD: What fault did your fathers
find in me that they withdrew from me, Went after empty idols, and became empty
themselves? 
6
They did not ask, "Where is the LORD who
brought us up from the land of Egypt, Who led us through the desert, through a
land of wastes and gullies, Through a land of drought and darkness, through a
land which no one crosses, where no man dwells?" 
7
When I brought you into the garden land to eat
its goodly fruits, You entered and defiled my land, you made my heritage loathsome.
8
[4]
 The priests asked not, "Where is the
LORD?" Those who dealt with the law knew me not: the shepherds rebelled
against me. The prophets prophesied by Baal, and went after useless idols. 
9
Therefore will I yet accuse you, says the LORD,
and even your children's children I will accuse. 
10
[5]
 Pass over to the coast of the Kittim and see,
send to Kedar and carefully inquire: Where has the like of this been done? 
11
Does any other nation change its gods? -  yet they are not gods at all! But my people
have changed their glory for useless things. 
12
Be amazed at this, O heavens, and shudder with
sheer horror, says the LORD. 
13
Two evils have my people done: they have
forsaken me, the source of living waters; They have dug themselves cisterns,
broken cisterns, that hold no water. 
14
[6]
 Is Israel a slave, a bondman by birth? Why
then has he become booty? 
15
Against him lions roar full-throated cries.
They have made his land a waste; his cities are charred ruins, without
inhabitant. 
16
[7]
 Yes, the people of Memphis and Tahpanhes shave
the crown of your head. 
17
Has not the forsaking of the LORD, your God,
done this to you? 
18
[8]
 And now, why go to Egypt, to drink the waters
of the Nile? Why go to Assyria, to drink the waters of the Euphrates? 
19
Your own wickedness chastises you, your own
infidelities punish you. Know then, and see, how evil and bitter is your
forsaking the LORD, your God, And showing no fear of me, says the Lord, the GOD
of hosts. 
20
[9]
 Long ago you broke your yoke, you tore off
your bonds. "I will not serve," you said. On every high hill, under
every green tree, you gave yourself to harlotry. 
21
I had planted you, a choice vine of fully
tested stock; How could you turn out obnoxious to me, a spurious vine? 
22
Though you scour it with soap, and use much
lye, The stain of your guilt is still before me, says the Lord GOD. 
23
[10]
 How can you say, "I am not defiled, I
have not gone after the Baals"? Consider your conduct in the Valley,
recall what you have done: A frenzied she-camel, coursing near and far, 
24
breaking away toward the desert, Snuffing the
wind in her ardor -  who can restrain
her lust? No beasts need tire themselves seeking her; in her month they will
meet her. 
25
Stop wearing out your shoes and parching your
throat! But you say, "No use! no! I love these strangers, and after them I
must go." 
26
As the thief is shamed when caught, so shall
the house of Israel be shamed: They, their kings and their princes, their
priests and their prophets; 
27
They who say to a piece of wood, "You are
my father," and to a stone, "You gave me birth." They turn to me
their backs, not their faces; yet, in their time of trouble they cry out,
"Rise up and save us!" 
28
Where are the gods you made for yourselves? Let
them rise up! Will they save you in your time of trouble? For as numerous as
your cities are your gods, O Judah! And as many as the streets of Jerusalem are
the altars you have set up for Baal. 
29
How dare you still plead with me? You have all
rebelled against me, says the LORD. 
30
In vain I struck your children; the correction
they did not take. Your sword devoured your prophets like a ravening lion. 
31
You, of this generation, take note of the word
of the Lord: Have I been a desert to Israel, a land of darkness? Why do my
people say, "We have moved on, we will come to you no more"? 
32
Does a virgin forget her jewelry, a bride her
sash? Yet my people have forgotten me days without number. 
33
How well you pick your way when seeking love!
You who, in your wickedness, have gone by ways unclean! 
34
You, on whose clothing there is the life-blood
of the innocent, whom you found committing no burglary; 
35
Yet withal you say, "I am innocent; at
least, his anger is turned away from me." Behold, I will judge you on that
word of yours, "I have not sinned." 
36
How very base you have become in changing your
course! By Egypt will you be shamed, as you were shamed by Assyria. 
37
From there also shall you go away with hands
upon your head; For the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust, with them
you will have no success.
1
 [1-3, 5] These verses probably
contain the earliest of Jeremiah's preachings. The covenant relationship,
symbolized by the figure of a marriage, was frequently broken by Israel, seen
here as an unfaithful wife unworthy of reconciliation with God
(
⇒
 Jeremiah 3:1-5). 
2
 [2] Devotion: Israel's gratitude,
fidelity, and love for God.
3
 [3] First fruits: an offering to
God which became his exclusive property, and could therefore not be put to
profane use; cf 
⇒
 Lev 22:1.
4
 [8] Those who dealt with the law:
the priests. The shepherds: the kings and nobles.
5
 [10] Kittim: a Phoenician colony in
Cyprus. Kedar: a nomad tribe of the Syrian desert. These two names represent
West and East.
6
 [14] Bondman by birth: a perpetual
slave, different from the debt-slave, who was to be freed after six years; cf
⇒
 Exodus 21:2.
7
 [16] Memphis: the capital of Lower
Egypt. Tahpanhes: A frontier city of Egypt, east of the Delta. Shave the crown
of your head: the spoilation of Judah at the hands of the Egyptians.
8
 [18] Egypt and Assyria were the
protecting foreign powers favored by rival parties within Judah. The desire for
such foreign alliances is a further desertion of the Lord, the source of living
waters (
⇒
 Jeremiah 2:13), in favor of the
above-named powers, symbolized by the Nile and the Euphrates rivers.
9
 [20] Harlotry: idolatry (because
Israel is the bride of God).
10
 [23] The Valley: of
Ben-hinnom, south of Jerusalem, site of the
infamous sanctuary of Topheth where children were sacrificed to Molech; cf
⇒
 Jeremiah 7:31.
