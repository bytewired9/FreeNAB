Introduction
The Book of
Jeremiah combines history, biography, and prophecy. It portrays a nation in
crisis and introduces the reader to an extraordinary leader upon whom the Lord
placed the heavy burden of the prophetic office. Jeremiah was born about 650
B.C. of a priestly family from the little village of Anathoth, near Jerusalem.
While still very young he was called to his task in the thirteenth year of King
Josiah (628), whose reform, begun with enthusiasm and hope, ended with his
death on the battlefield of Megiddo (609) as he attempted to stop the northward
march of the Egyptian Pharaoh Neco.
The prophet heartily supported
the reform of the pious King Josiah, which began in 629 B.C. Nineveh, the
capital of Assyria, fell in 612, preparing the way for the new colossus,
Babylon, which was soon to put an end to Judean independence.
After the death of Josiah
the old idolatry returned. Jeremiah opposed it with all his strength. Arrest,
imprisonment, and public disgrace were his lot. Jeremiah saw in the nation's
impenitence the sealing of its doom. Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem and
carried King Jehoiachin into exile (
⇒
22:24).
During the years 598-587,
Jeremiah attempted to counsel Zedekiah in the face of bitter opposition. The
false prophet Hananiah proclaimed that the yoke of Babylon was broken and a
strong pro-Egyptian party in Jerusalem induced Zedekiah to revolt.
Nebuchadnezzar took swift and terrible vengeance; Jerusalem was destroyed in
587 and its leading citizens sent into exile. About this time Jeremiah uttered
the great oracle of the "New Covenant" (
⇒
31:31-34) sometimes called "The Gospel before the Gospel."
This passage contains his most sublime teaching and is a landmark in Old
Testament theology.
The prophet remained amidst
the ruins of Jerusalem, but was later forced into Egyptian exile by a band of
conspirators. There, according to an old tradition, he was murdered by his own
countrymen. The influence of Jeremiah was greater after his death than before.
The exiled community read and meditated on the lessons of the prophet, and his influence
can be seen in Ezekiel, certain of the psalms, and the second part of Isaiah.
Shortly after the exile, the Book of Jeremiah as we have it today was published
in a final edition.
