Now Jericho was in a state of siege because of
the presence of the Israelites, so that no one left or entered. 
2
And to Joshua the LORD said, "I have
delivered Jericho and its king into your power. 
3
Have all the soldiers circle the city, marching
once around it. Do this for six days, 
4
with seven priests carrying ram's horns ahead
of the ark. On the seventh day march around the city seven times, and have the
priests blow the horns. 
5
When they give a long blast on the ram's horns
and you hear that signal, all the people shall shout aloud. The wall of the
city will collapse, and they will be able to make a frontal attack." 
6
Summoning the priests, Joshua, son of Nun, then
ordered them to take up the ark of the covenant with seven of the priests
carrying ram's horns in front of the ark of the LORD. 
7
And he ordered the people to proceed in a
circle around the city, with the picked troops marching ahead of the ark of the
LORD. 
8
At this order they proceeded, with the seven
priests who carried the ram's horns before the LORD blowing their horns, and
the ark of the covenant of the LORD following them. 
9
In front of the priests with the horns marched
the picked troops; the rear guard followed the ark, and the blowing of horns
was kept up continually as they marched. 
10
But the people had been commanded by Joshua not
to shout or make any noise or outcry until he gave the word: only then were
they to shout. 
11
So he had the ark of the LORD circle the city,
going once around it, after which they returned to camp for the night. 
12
Early the next morning, Joshua had the priests
take up the ark of the LORD. 
13
The seven priests bearing the ram's horns
marched in front of the ark of the LORD, blowing their horns. Ahead of these
marched the picked troops, while the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD,
and the blowing of horns was kept up continually. 
14
On this second day they again marched around
the city once before returning to camp; and for six days in all they did the
same. 
15
On the seventh day, beginning at daybreak, they
marched around the city seven times in the same manner; on that day only did
they march around the city seven times. 
16
The seventh time around, the priests blew the
horns and Joshua said to the people, "Now shout, for the LORD has given
you the city 
17
and everything in it. It is under the LORD'S ban.
Only the harlot Rahab and all who are in the house with her are to be spared,
because she hid the messengers we sent. 
18
[1]
 But be careful not to take, in your greed,
anything that is under the ban; else you will bring upon the camp of Israel
this ban and the misery of it. 
19
All silver and gold, and the articles of bronze
or iron, are sacred to the LORD. They shall be put in the treasury of the
LORD." 
20
[2]
 As the horns blew, the people began to shout.
When they heard the signal horn, they raised a tremendous shout. The wall
collapsed, and the people stormed the city in a frontal attack and took it. 
21
They observed the ban by putting to the sword
all living creatures in the city: men and women, young and old, as well as
oxen, sheep and asses. 
22
Joshua directed the two men who had spied out
the land, "Go into the harlot's house and bring out the woman with all her
kin, as you swore to her you would do." 
23
The spies entered and brought out Rahab, with
her father, mother, brothers, and all her kin. Her entire family they led forth
and placed them outside the camp of Israel. 
24
The city itself they burned with all that was
in it, except the silver, gold, and articles of bronze and iron, which were
placed in the treasury of the house of the LORD. 
25
[3]
 Because Rahab the harlot had hidden the
messengers whom Joshua had sent to reconnoiter Jericho, Joshua spared her with
her family and all her kin, who continue in the midst of Israel to this day. 
26
[4]
 On that occasion Joshua imposed the oath:
Cursed before the LORD be the man who attempts to rebuild this city, Jericho.
He shall lose his first-born when he lays its foundation, and he shall lose his
youngest son when he sets up its gates. 
27
Thus the LORD was with Joshua so that his fame
spread throughout the land.

 [18] That is under the ban: that is
doomed to destruction; see notes on

 Lev 27:29;

 Numbers 18:14;

 [20] The wall collapsed: by the
miraculous intervention of God. The blowing of the horns and the shouting of
the people were a customary feature of ancient warfare, here intended by God as
a test of the people's obedience and of their faith in his promise; cf
⇒
 Hebrews 11:30.

 [25] From 
⇒
 Matthew
1:5, we learn that Rahab married Salmon of the tribe of Judah and thus
became the great-great-grand-mother of David, Christ's ancestor; cf

 Ruth 4:18-22.

 [26] He shall lose his first-born .
. . its gates: this curse was fulfilled when Hiel rebuilt Jericho as a
fortified city during the reign of Ahab, king of Israel; cf
⇒
 1 Kings 16:34. Till then Jericho was merely an
unwalled village; cf
