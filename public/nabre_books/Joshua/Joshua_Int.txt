Introduction 
The Book of
Joshua derives its name from the successor of Moses, with whose deeds it is
principally concerned. The purpose of the book is to demonstrate God's fidelity
in giving to the Israelites the land he had promised them for an inheritance
(
⇒
 Genesis 15:18-20; 
⇒
1:2-4; 
⇒
 21:41-43;
⇒
 23:14-16).
Their
occupation of the country is begun with the crossing of the Jordan and the
conquest of Jericho (Jos 1-6), in both of which the Lord intervenes on their
behalf. This is followed by a first foothold on the Palestinian mountain range,
at Ai, Bethel, and Gibeon (Jos 7-9), and two sweeping campaigns against the
city states in the south of the country (Jos 10) and in the north (Jos 11),
with a summary in Jos 12. The broad claim to total sovereignty thus established
is spelled out by a combined list of tribal boundaries and of the towns
contained within each area or administrative district (Jos 13-19), including
cities of asylum and cities for the Levites (Joshua
20:21). The book closes with a narrative about the tribes east of
the Jordan (Jos 22), a warning speech by Joshua (Jos 23), and a renewal at
Shechem (Jos 24) of the covenant with the Lord, already affirmed there near the
beginning of the conquest (
⇒
 Joshua 8:30-35).
Like the books which
precede it, the Book of Joshua was built up by a long and complex process of
editing traditional materials. Both Jewish and Christian believers have always
regarded it as inspired.
The entire history of the
conquest of the Promised Land is a prophecy of the spiritual conquest of the
world through the Church under the leadership of Jesus the Messiah.
The Book of Joshua may be
divided as follows:
I.

of Canaan (

Return
of the Transjordan Tribes and Joshua's Farewell (
⇒
