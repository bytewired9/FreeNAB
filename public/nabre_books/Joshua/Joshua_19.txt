1
The second lot fell to Simeon. The heritage of
the clans of the tribe of Simeonites lay within that of the Judahites. 
2
For their heritage they received Beer-sheba,
Shema, Moladah, 
3
Hazar-shual, Balah, Ezem, 
4
Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, 
5
Ziklag, Bethmar-caboth, Hazar-susah, 
6
Beth-lebaoth and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and
their villages. 
7
Also En-rimmon, Ether and Ashan; four cities
and their villages, 
8
besides all the villages around these cities as
far as Baalath-beer (that is, Ramoth-negeb). This was the heritage of the clans
of the tribe of the Simeonites. 
9
This heritage of the Simeonites was within the
confines of the Judahites; for since the portion of the latter was too large
for them, the Simeonites obtained their heritage within it. 
10
[1]
 The third lot fell to the clans of the
Zebulunites. The limit of their heritage was at Sarid. 
11
Their boundary went up west. . . and through
Mareal, reaching Dabbesheth and the wadi that is near Jokneam. 
12
From Sarid eastward it ran to the district of
Chisloth-tabor, on to Daberath, and up to Japhia. 
13
From there it continued eastward to Gath-hepher
and to Eth-kazin, extended to Rimmon, and turned to Neah. 
14
Skirting north of Hannathon, the boundary ended
at the valley of Iphtahel. 
15
Thus, with Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah
and Bethlehem, there were twelve cities and their villages 
16
to comprise the heritage of the clans of the
Zebulunites. 
17
[2]
 The fourth lot fell to Issachar. The territory
of the clans of the Issacharites 
18
included Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem, 
19
Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath, 
20
Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez, 
21
Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah and Beth-pazzez. 
22
The boundary reached Tabor, Shahazumah and
Beth-shemesh, ending at the Jordan. These sixteen cities and their villages 
23
were the heritage of the clans of the
Issacharites. 
24
[3]
 The fifth lot fell to the clans of the tribe
of the Asherites. 
25
Their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten,
Achshaph, 
26
Allammelech, Amad and Mishal, and reached
Carmel on the west, and Shihor-libnath. 
27
In the other direction, it ran eastward of
Beth-dagon, reached Zebulun and the valley of Iphtahel; then north of Beth-emek
and Neiel, it extended to Cabul, 
28
Mishal, Abdon, Rehob, Hammon and Kanah, near
Greater Sidon. 
29
Then the boundary turned back to Ramah and to
the fortress city of Tyre; thence it cut back to Hosah and ended at the sea.
Thus, with Mahalab, Achzib, 
30
Ummah, Acco, Aphek and Rehob, there were
twenty-two cities and their villages 
31
to comprise the heritage of the clans of the
tribe of the Asherites. 
32
[4]
 The sixth lot fell to the Naphtalites. The
boundary of the clans of the Naphtalites 
33
extended from Heleph, from the oak at Zaanannim
to Lakkum, including Adami-nekeb and Jabneel, and ended at the Jordan. 
34
In the opposite direction, westerly, it ran through
Aznoth-tabor and from there extended to Hukkok; it touched Zebulun on the
south, Asher on the west, and the Jordan on the east. 
35
The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath,
Rakkath, Chinnereth, 
36
Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, 
37
Kedesh, Edrei, En-hazor, 
38
Yiron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath and
Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities and their villages, 
39
to comprise the heritage of the clans of the
tribe of the Naphtalites. 
40
[5]
 The seventh lot fell to the clans of the tribe
of Danites. 
41
Their heritage was the territory of Zorah,
Eshtaol, Ir-shemesh, 
42
Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah, 
43
Elon, Timnah, Ekron, 
44
Eltekoh, Gibbethon, Baalath, 
45
Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon, 
46
Me-jarkon and Rakkon, with the coast at Joppa. 
47
[6]
 But the territory of the Danites was too small
for them; so the Danites marched up and attacked Leshem, which they captured
and put to the sword. Once they had taken possession of Leshem, they renamed
the settlement after their ancestor Dan. 
48
These cities and their villages were the
heritage of the clans of the tribe of the Danites. 
49
When the last of them had received the portions
of the land they were to inherit, the Israelites assigned a heritage in their
midst to Joshua, son of Nun. 
50
In obedience to the command of the LORD, they
gave him the city which he requested, Timnah-serah in the mountain region of
Ephraim. He rebuilt the city and made it his home. 
51
These are the final portions into which Eleazar
the priest, Joshua, son of Nun, and the heads of families in the tribes of the
Israelites divided the land by lot in the presence of the LORD, at the door of
the meeting tent in Shiloh. 
1
 [10-16] Zebulun's territory was in
the central section of the Plain of Esdraelon and of southern Galilee; it was
bounded on the south by Manasseh, on the southeast by Issachar, on the
northeast and north by Naphtali, and on the west by Asher. The site of the
later city of Nazareth was within its borders. Bethlehem of Zebulun was, of
course, distinct from the city of the same name in Judah. Twelve cities:
apparently seven of the names are missing from 
⇒
19:15 unless some of the places mentioned in
⇒
 Joshua 19:12-14 are to be included in the number.
2
 [17-23] Issachar's land was on the
eastern watershed of the Plain of Esdraelon, but also included the southeastern
end of the Galilean mountains. It was surrounded by Manasseh on the south and
east, by Naphtali on the north, and by Zebulun on the west. Jezreel
(
⇒
 Joshua 19:18) dominated the plain to which it
gave its name, the later form of which was Esdraelon.
3
 [24-31] Asher inherited the western
slope of the Galilean hills as far as the sea, with Manasseh to the south,
Zebulun and Naphtali to the east, and Phoenicia to the north.
4
 [32-39] Naphtali received eastern
Galilee; Asher was to the west and Zebulun and Issachar were to the south,
while the upper Jordan and Mount Hermon formed the eastern border. Part of the
tribe of Dan later on occupied the northern extremity of Naphtali's lands, at
the sources of the Jordan (
⇒
 Joshua 19:47).
5
 [40-46] The original territory of
Dan was a small enclave between Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim and the Philistines.
