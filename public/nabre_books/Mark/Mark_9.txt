[1]
 He also said to them, "Amen, I say to
you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that
the kingdom of God has come in power." 
2
[2]
 After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and
John and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves. And he was
transfigured before them, 
3
and his clothes became dazzling white, such as
no fuller on earth could bleach them. 
4
Then Elijah appeared to them along with Moses,
and they were conversing with Jesus. 
5
[3]
 Then Peter said to Jesus in reply,
"Rabbi, it is good that we are here! Let us make three tents: one for you,
one for Moses, and one for Elijah." 
6
He hardly knew what to say, they were so
terrified. 
7
Then a cloud came, casting a shadow over them; 
[4]
then from the cloud came a voice, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to
him." 
8
Suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw
anyone but Jesus alone with them. 
9
[5]
 As they were coming down from the mountain, he
charged them not to relate what they had seen to anyone, except when the Son of
Man had risen from the dead. 
10
So they kept the matter to themselves,
questioning what rising from the dead meant. 
11
Then they asked him, "Why do the scribes
say that Elijah must come first?" 
12
He told them, "Elijah will indeed come
first and restore all things, yet how is it written regarding the Son of Man
that he must suffer greatly and be treated with contempt? 
13
But I tell you that Elijah has come and they
did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him." 
14
[6]
 When they came to the disciples, they saw a
large crowd around them and scribes arguing with them. 
15
Immediately on seeing him, the whole crowd was
utterly amazed. They ran up to him and greeted him. 
16
He asked them, "What are you arguing about
with them?" 
17
Someone from the crowd answered him,
"Teacher, I have brought to you my son possessed by a mute spirit. 
18
Wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he
foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples
to drive it out, but they were unable to do so." 
19
He said to them in reply, "O faithless
generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I endure you? Bring him
to me." 
20
They brought the boy to him. And when he saw
him, the spirit immediately threw the boy into convulsions. As he fell to the
ground, he began to roll around and foam at the mouth. 
21
Then he questioned his father, "How long
has this been happening to him?" He replied, "Since childhood. 
22
It has often thrown him into fire and into
water to kill him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help
us." 
23
Jesus said to him, " 'If you can!'
Everything is possible to one who has faith." 
24
Then the boy's father cried out, "I do
believe, help my unbelief!" 
25
Jesus, on seeing a crowd rapidly gathering, rebuked
the unclean spirit and said to it, "Mute and deaf spirit, I command you:
come out of him and never enter him again!" 
26
Shouting and throwing the boy into convulsions,
it came out. He became like a corpse, which caused many to say, "He is
dead!" 
27
But Jesus took him by the hand, raised him, and
he stood up. 
28
When he entered the house, his disciples asked
him in private, "Why could we not drive it out?" 
29
[7]
 He said to them, "This kind can only come
out through prayer." 
30
They left from there and began a journey
through Galilee, but he did not wish anyone to know about it. 
31
He was teaching his disciples and telling them,
"The Son of Man is to be handed over to men and they will kill him, and
three days after his death he will rise." 
32
But they did not understand the saying, and
they were afraid to question him. 
33
[8]
 They came to Capernaum and, once inside the
house, he began to ask them, "What were you arguing about on the
way?" 
34
But they remained silent. They had been
discussing among themselves on the way who was the greatest. 
35
Then he sat down, called the Twelve, and said
to them, "If anyone wishes to be first, he shall be the last of all and
the servant of all." 
36
Taking a child he placed it in their midst, and
putting his arms around it he said to them, 
37
"Whoever receives one child such as this
in my name, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but the one
who sent me." 
38
[9]
 John said to him, "Teacher, we saw
someone driving out demons in your name, and we tried to prevent him because he
does not follow us." 
39
Jesus replied, "Do not prevent him. There
is no one who performs a mighty deed in my name who can at the same time speak
ill of me. 
40
For whoever is not against us is for us. 
41
Anyone who gives you a cup of water to drink
because you belong to Christ, amen, I say to you, will surely not lose his
reward. 
42
"Whoever causes one of these little ones
who believe (in me) to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone
were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea. 
43
If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It
is better for you to enter into life maimed than with two hands to go into
Gehenna, 
[10]
 into the unquenchable fire. 
44
[11]
45
And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off.
It is better for you to enter into life crippled than with two feet to be thrown
into Gehenna. 
47
And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it
out. Better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than with two
eyes to be thrown into Gehenna, 
48
where 'their worm does not die, and the fire is
not quenched.' 
49
[12]
 "Everyone will be salted with fire. 
50
Salt is good, but if salt becomes insipid, with
what will you restore its flavor? Keep salt in yourselves and you will have
peace with one another."

 [1] There are some standing . . .
come in power: understood by some to refer to the establishment by God's power
of his kingdom on earth in and through the church; more likely, as understood
by others, a reference to the imminent parousia. 
2
 [2-8] Mark and
⇒
 Matthew 17:1 place the transfiguration of Jesus
six days after the first prediction of his passion and death and his
instruction to the disciples on the doctrine of the cross; 
⇒
 Luke
9:28 has "about eight days." Thus the transfiguration
counterbalances the prediction of the passion by affording certain of the
disciples insight into the divine glory that Jesus possessed. His glory will
overcome his death and that of his disciples; cf 
⇒
 2 Cor
3:18; 
⇒
 2 Peter 1:16-19. The heavenly
voice (
⇒
 Mark 9:7) prepares the disciples to
understand that in the divine plan Jesus must die ignominiously before his
messianic glory is made manifest; cf 
⇒
 Luke
24:25-27. See further the note on 
⇒
 Matthew
17:1-8.
3
 [5] Moses and Elijah represent
respectively law and prophecy in the Old Testament and are linked to Matthew.
Sinai; cf 
⇒
 Exodus
19:16-
⇒
 20:17; 
⇒
 1
Kings 19:2, 
⇒
 8-14. They now appear with
Jesus as witnesses to the fulfillment of the law and the prophets taking place
in the person of Jesus as he appears in glory.
4
 [7] A cloud came, casting a shadow
over them: even the disciples enter into the mystery of his glorification. In
the Old Testament the cloud covered the meeting tent, indicating the Lord's
presence in the midst of his people (
⇒
 Exodus
40:34-35) and came to rest upon the temple in Jerusalem at the time
of its dedication (
⇒
 1 Kings 8:10).
5
 [9-13] At the transfiguration of
Jesus his disciples had seen Elijah. They were perplexed because, according to
the rabbinical interpretation of 
⇒
 Malachi 3:23-24,
Elijah was to come first. Jesus' response shows that Elijah has come, in the
person of John the Baptist, to prepare for the day of the Lord. Jesus must
suffer greatly and be treated with contempt (
⇒
9:12) like the Baptist (
⇒
 Mark 9:13); cf
⇒
 Mark 6:17-29.
6
 [14-29] The disciples' failure to
effect a cure seems to reflect unfavorably on Jesus (
⇒
9:14-18, 
⇒
 22). In response Jesus exposes
their lack of trust in God (
⇒
 Mark 4:19) and scores
their lack of prayer (
⇒
 Mark 4:29), i.e., of
conscious reliance on God's power when acting in Jesus' name. For Matthew, see
the note on 
⇒
 Matthew 17:14-20. 
⇒
 Luke
9:37-43 centers attention on Jesus' sovereign power.
7
 [29] This kind can only come out
through prayer: a variant reading adds "and through fasting."
8
 [33-37] Mark probably intends this incident
and the sayings that follow as commentary on the disciples' lack of
understanding (
⇒
 Mark 9:32). Their role in Jesus'
work is one of service, especially to the poor and lowly. Children were the
symbol Jesus used for the anawim, the poor in spirit, the lowly in the
Christian community.
9
 [38-41] Jesus warns against
jealousy and intolerance toward others, such as exorcists who do not follow us.
The saying in 
⇒
 Mark 9:40 is a broad principle of
the divine tolerance. Even the smallest courtesies shown to those who teach in
Jesus' name do not go unrewarded.
10
 [43,45,47] Gehenna: see the note on
⇒
 Matthew 5:22.
11
 [44,46] These verses, lacking in
some important early manuscripts, are here omitted as scribal additions. They
simply repeat 
⇒
 Mark 9:48 itself a modified citation
of 
⇒
 Isaiah 66:24.
12
 [49] Everyone will be salted with
fire: so the better manuscripts. Some add "every sacrifice will be salted
with salt." The purifying and preservative use of salt in food
(
⇒
 Lev 2:13) and the refinement effected through
fire refer here to comparable effects in the spiritual life of the disciples of
Jesus.
