[1]
[2]
 The beginning of the
gospel of Jesus Christ (the Son of God). 
2
As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: 
[3]
"Behold, I am sending my messenger ahead of you; he will prepare your way.
3
A voice of one crying out in the desert:
'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.'" 
4
John (the) Baptist appeared in the desert proclaiming
a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 
5
People of the whole Judean countryside and all
the inhabitants of Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by
him in the Jordan River as they acknowledged their sins. 
6
John was clothed in camel's hair, with a
leather belt around his waist. 
[4]
 He fed on locusts and wild
honey. 
7
And this is what he proclaimed: "One
mightier than I is coming after me. I am not worthy to stoop and loosen the
thongs of his sandals. 
8
[5]
 I have baptized you with water; he will
baptize you with the holy Spirit." 
9
It happened in those days that Jesus came from
Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John. 
10
On coming up out of the water he saw the
heavens being torn open and the Spirit, like a dove, descending upon him. 
[6]
11
And a voice came from the heavens, "You
are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased." 
12
[7]
 At once the Spirit drove him out into the
desert, 
13
and he remained in the desert for forty days,
tempted by Satan. He was among wild beasts, and the angels ministered to him. 
14
After John had been arrested, 
[8]
Jesus came to Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God: 
15
"This is the time of fulfillment. The
kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel." 
16
[9]
 As he passed by the Sea of Galilee, he saw
Simon and his brother Andrew casting their nets into the sea; they were
fishermen. 
17
Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I
will make you fishers of men." 
18
Then they abandoned their nets and followed
him. 
19
He walked along a little farther and saw James,
the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They too were in a boat mending their
nets. 
20
Then he called them. So they left their father
Zebedee in the boat along with the hired men and followed him. 
21
[10]
 Then they came to Capernaum, and on the
sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught. 
22
The people were astonished at his teaching, for
he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes. 
23
[11]
 In their synagogue was a man with an unclean
spirit; 
24
[12]
 he cried out, "What have you to do with
us, 
[13]
 Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I
know who you are - the Holy One of God!" 
25
Jesus rebuked him and said, "Quiet! Come
out of him!" 
26
The unclean spirit convulsed him and with a
loud cry came out of him. 
27
All were amazed and asked one another,
"What is this? A new teaching with authority. He commands even the unclean
spirits and they obey him." 
28
His fame spread everywhere throughout the whole
region of Galilee. 
29
On leaving the synagogue he entered the house
of Simon and Andrew with James and John. 
30
Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever.
They immediately told him about her. 
31
He approached, grasped her hand, and helped her
up. Then the fever left her and she waited on them. 
32
When it was evening, after sunset, they brought
to him all who were ill or possessed by demons. 
33
The whole town was gathered at the door. 
34
He cured many who were sick with various
diseases, and he drove out many demons, not permitting them to speak because
they knew him. 
35
Rising very early before dawn, he left and went
off to a deserted place, where he prayed. 
36
Simon and those who were with him pursued him 
37
and on finding him said, "Everyone is
looking for you." 
38
He told them, "Let us go on to the nearby
villages that I may preach there also. For this purpose have I come." 
39
So he went into their synagogues, preaching and
driving out demons throughout the whole of Galilee. 
40
A leper 
[14]
 came to him (and
kneeling down) begged him and said, "If you wish, you can make me
clean." 
41
Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand,
touched him, and said to him, "I do will it. Be made clean." 
42
The leprosy left him immediately, and he was
made clean. 
43
Then, warning him sternly, he dismissed him at
once. 
44
Then he said to him, "See that you tell no
one anything, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing
what Moses prescribed; that will be proof for them." 
45
The man went away and began to publicize the
whole matter. He spread the report abroad so that it was impossible for Jesus
to enter a town openly. He remained outside in deserted places, and people kept
coming to him from everywhere. 
1
 [1-13] The prologue of the Gospel
according to Mark begins with the title (
⇒
 Mark 1:1)
followed by three events preparatory to Jesus' preaching: (1) the appearance in
the Judean wilderness of John, baptizer, preacher of repentance, and precursor
of Jesus (
⇒
 Mark 1:2-8); (2) the baptism of Jesus, at
which a voice from heaven acknowledges Jesus to be God's Son, and the holy
Spirit descends on him (
⇒
 Mark 1:9-11); (3) the
temptation of Jesus by Satan (
⇒
 Mark 1:12-13).
2
 [1] The gospel of Jesus Christ [the
Son of God]: the "good news" of salvation in and through Jesus,
crucified and risen, acknowledged by the Christian community as Messiah
(
⇒
 Mark 8:29; 
⇒
 14:61-62)
and Son of God (
⇒
 Mark 1:11;
⇒
 9:7; 
⇒
 15:39), although
some important manuscripts here omit the Son of God. 
3
 [2-3] Although Mark attributes the
prophecy to Isaiah, the text is a combination of 
⇒
 Malachi
3:1; 
⇒
 Isaiah 40:3;
⇒
 Exodus 23:20; cf 
⇒
 Matthew
11:10; 
⇒
 Luke 7:27. John's ministry is
seen as God's prelude to the saving mission of his Son. The way of the Lord:
this prophecy of Deutero-Isaiah concerning the end of the Babylonian exile is
here applied to the coming of Jesus; John the Baptist is to prepare the way for
him.
4
 [6] Clothed in camel's hair . . .
waist: the Baptist's garb recalls that of Elijah in 
⇒
 2 Kings
1:8. Jesus speaks of the Baptist as Elijah who has already come
(
⇒
 Mark 9:11-13; 
⇒
 Matthew
17:10-12; cf 
⇒
 Malachi 3:23-24;
⇒
 Luke 1:17).
5
 [8-9] Through the life-giving
baptism with the holy Spirit (
⇒
 Mark 1:8), Jesus will
create a new people of God. But first he identifies himself with the people of
Israel in submitting to John's baptism of repentance and in bearing on their
behalf the burden of God's decisive judgment (
⇒
1:9; cf 
⇒
 Mark 1:4). As in the desert of
Sinai, so here in the wilderness of Judea, Israel's sonship with God is to be
renewed.
6
 [10-11] He saw the heavens . . .
and the Spirit . . . upon him: indicating divine intervention in fulfillment of
promise. Here the descent of the Spirit on Jesus is meant, anointing him for
his ministry; cf 
⇒
 Isaiah 11:2;
⇒
 42:1; 
⇒
 61:1;
⇒
 63:9. A voice . . . with you I am well pleased:
God's acknowledgment of Jesus as his unique Son, the object of his love. His
approval of Jesus is the assurance that Jesus will fulfill his messianic
mission of salvation.
7
 [12-13] The same Spirit who
descended on Jesus in his baptism now drives him into the desert for forty
days. The result is radical confrontation and temptation by Satan who attempts
to frustrate the work of God. The presence of wild beasts may indicate the
horror and danger of the desert regarded as the abode of demons or may reflect
the paradise motif of harmony among all creatures; cf 
⇒
 Isaiah
11:6-9. The presence of ministering angels to sustain Jesus recalls
the angel who guided the Israelites in the desert in the first Exodus
(
⇒
 Exodus 14:19;
⇒
 23:20) and the angel who supplied nourishment to
Elijah in the wilderness (
⇒
 1 Kings 19:5-7). The
combined forces of good and evil were present to Jesus in the desert. His
sustained obedience brings forth the new Israel of God there where Israel's
rebellion had brought death and alienation.
8
 [14-15] After John had been
arrested: in the plan of God, Jesus was not to proclaim the good news of
salvation prior to the termination of the Baptist's active mission. Galilee: in
the Marcan account, scene of the major part of Jesus' public ministry before
his arrest and condemnation. The gospel of God: not only the good news from God
but about God at work in Jesus Christ. This is the time of fulfillment: i.e.,
of God's promises. The kingdom of God . . . repent: see the note on
⇒
 Matthew 3:2.
9
 [16-20] These verses narrate the
call of the first Disciples. See the notes on 
⇒
 Matthew
4:18-22 and 
⇒
 Matthew 4:20.
10
 [21-45] The account of a single
day's ministry of Jesus on a sabbath in and outside the synagogue of Capernaum
(
⇒
 Mark 1:21-31) combines teaching and miracles of
exorcism and healing. Mention is not made of the content of the teaching but of
the effect of astonishment and alarm on the people. Jesus' teaching with
authority, making an absolute claim on the hearer, was in the best tradition of
the ancient prophets, not of the scribes. The narrative continues with events
that evening (
⇒
 Mark 1:32-34; see the notes on
⇒
 Matthew 8:14-17) and the next day (
⇒
1:35-39). The cleansing in 
⇒
 Mark 1:40-45
stands as an isolated story.
11
 [23] An unclean spirit: so called
because of the spirit's resistance to the holiness of God. The spirit knows and
fears the power of Jesus to destroy his influence; cf 
⇒
1:32, 
⇒
 34;
⇒
 3:11; 
⇒
 6:13.
12
 [24-25] The Holy One of God: not a
confession but an attempt to ward off Jesus' power, reflecting the notion that
use of the precise name of an opposing spirit would guarantee mastery over him.
Jesus silenced the cry of the unclean spirit and drove him out of the man.
13
 [24] What have you to do with us?:
see the note on 
⇒
 John 2:4.
14
 [40] A leper: for the various forms
of skin disease, see 
⇒
 Lev 13:1-50 and the note on
⇒
 Lev 13:2-4. There are only two instances in the
Old Testament in which God is shown to have cured a leper
(
⇒
 Numbers 12:10-15; 
⇒
 2 Kings
5:1-14). The law of Moses provided for the ritual purification of a
leper. In curing the leper, Jesus assumes that the priests will reinstate the
cured man into the religious community. See also the note on
⇒
 Luke 5:14.
