As soon as morning came, the chief priests with
the elders and the scribes, that is, the whole Sanhedrin, held a council. 
[1]
They bound Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate. 
2
Pilate questioned him, "Are you the king
of the Jews?" 
[2]
 He said to him in reply, "You say
so." 
3
The chief priests accused him of many things. 
4
Again Pilate questioned him, "Have you no
answer? See how many things they accuse you of." 
5
Jesus gave him no further answer, so that
Pilate was amazed. 
6
[3]
 Now on the occasion of the feast he used to
release to them one prisoner whom they requested. 
7
A man called Barabbas 
[4]
 was
then in prison along with the rebels who had committed murder in a rebellion. 
8
The crowd came forward and began to ask him to
do for them as he was accustomed. 
9
Pilate answered, "Do you want me to
release to you the king of the Jews?" 
10
For he knew that it was out of envy that the
chief priests had handed him over. 
11
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to
have him release Barabbas for them instead. 
12
Pilate again said to them in reply, "Then
what (do you want) me to do with (the man you call) the king of the Jews?"
13
[5]
 They shouted again, "Crucify him." 
14
Pilate said to them, "Why? What evil has
he done?" They only shouted the louder, "Crucify him." 
15
[6]
 So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd,
released Barabbas to them and, after he had Jesus scourged, handed him over to
be crucified. 
16
[7]
 The soldiers led him away inside the palace,
that is, the praetorium, and assembled the whole cohort. 
17
They clothed him in purple and, weaving a crown
of thorns, placed it on him. 
18
They began to salute him with, "Hail, King
of the Jews!" 
19
and kept striking his head with a reed and
spitting upon him. They knelt before him in homage. 
20
And when they had mocked him, they stripped him
of the purple cloak, dressed him in his own clothes, and led him out to crucify
him. 
21
They pressed into service a passer-by, Simon, a
Cyrenian, 
[8]
 who was coming in from the country, the father
of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. 
22
They brought him to the place of Golgotha
(which is translated Place of the Skull). 
23
They gave him wine drugged with myrrh, but he
did not take it. 
24
[9]
 Then they crucified him and divided his
garments by casting lots for them to see what each should take. 
25
It was nine o'clock in the morning 
[10]
when they crucified him. 
26
[11]
 The inscription of the charge against him
read, "The King of the Jews." 
27
With him they crucified two revolutionaries,
one on his right and one on his left. 
28
) 
[12]
29
[13]
 Those passing by reviled him, shaking their
heads and saying, "Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in
three days, 
30
save yourself by coming down from the
cross." 
31
Likewise the chief priests, with the scribes,
mocked him among themselves and said, "He saved others; he cannot save
himself. 
32
Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, come down
now from the cross that we may see and believe." Those who were crucified
with him also kept abusing him. 
33
At noon darkness came over the whole land until
three in the afternoon. 
34
And at three o'clock Jesus cried out in a loud
voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" 
[14]
 which is
translated, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" 
35
[15]
 Some of the bystanders who heard it said,
"Look, he is calling Elijah." 
36
One of them ran, soaked a sponge with wine, put
it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Wait, let us see if
Elijah comes to take him down." 
37
Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last. 
38
[16]
 The veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from
top to bottom. 
39
[17]
 When the centurion who stood facing him saw
how he breathed his last he said, "Truly this man was the Son of
God!" 
40
[18]
 There were also women looking on from a
distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of the younger James
and of Joses, and Salome. 
41
These women had followed him when he was in
Galilee and ministered to him. There were also many other women who had come up
with him to Jerusalem. 
42
When it was already evening, since it was the
day of preparation, the day before the sabbath, 
43
Joseph of Arimathea, 
[19]
 a
distinguished member of the council, who was himself awaiting the kingdom of
God, came and courageously went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 
44
Pilate was amazed that he was already dead. He
summoned the centurion and asked him if Jesus had already died. 
45
And when he learned of it from the centurion,
he gave the body to Joseph. 
46
Having bought a linen cloth, he took him down,
wrapped him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb that had been hewn out of
the rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb. 
47
Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses
watched where he was laid.

 [1] Held a council: the verb here,
poieo, can mean either "convene a council" or "take
counsel." This reading is preferred to a variant "reached a
decision" (cf 
⇒
 Mark 3:6), which
⇒
 Mark 14:64 describes as having happened at the
night trial; see the note on 
⇒
 Matthew 27:1-2.
Handed him over to Pilate: lacking authority to execute their sentence of
condemnation (
⇒
 Mark 14:64), the Sanhedrin had
recourse to Pilate to have Jesus tried and put to death
(
⇒
 Mark 15:15); cf 
⇒
 John
18:31. 
2
 [2] The king of the Jews: in the
accounts of the evangelists a certain irony surrounds the use of this title as
an accusation against Jesus (see the note on 
⇒
15:26). While Pilate uses this term (
⇒
15:2, 9,
⇒
 12), he is aware of the evil motivation of the
chief priests who handed Jesus over for trial and condemnation
(

23:14-16,

 [21] They pressed into service . .
. Simon, a Cyrenian: a condemned person was constrained to bear his own
instrument of torture, at least the crossbeam. The precise naming of Simon and
his sons is probably due to their being known among early Christian believers
to whom Mark addressed his gospel. See also the notes on

noon. Cf

 [39] The closing portion of Mark's
gospel returns to the theme of its beginning in the Gentile centurion's
climactic declaration of belief that Jesus was the Son of God. It indicates the
fulfillment of the good news announced in the prologue (
⇒
1:1) and may be regarded as the firstfruit of the passion and death
of Jesus.
