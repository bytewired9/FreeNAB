Introduction
Introduction
This shortest of
all New Testament gospels is likely the first to have been written, yet it often
tells of Jesus' ministry in more detail than either Matthew or Luke (for
example, the miracle stories at 
⇒
 Mark 5:1-20 or
⇒
 Mark 9:14-29). It recounts what Jesus did in a
vivid style, where one incident follows directly upon another. In this almost
breathless narrative, Mark stresses Jesus' message about the kingdom of God now
breaking into human life as good news (
⇒
1:14-15) and Jesus himself as the gospel of God (
⇒
1:1; 
⇒
 8:35;
⇒
 10:29). Jesus is the Son whom God has sent to
rescue humanity by serving and by sacrificing his life
(
⇒
 Mark 10:45). 
The opening verse about
good news in Mark (
⇒
 Mark 1:1) serves as a title for
the entire book. The action begins with the appearance of John the Baptist, a
messenger of God attested by scripture. But John points to a mightier one,
Jesus, at whose baptism God speaks from heaven, declaring Jesus his Son. The
Spirit descends upon Jesus, who eventually, it is promised, will baptize
"with the holy Spirit." This presentation of who Jesus really is
(
⇒
 Mark 1:1-13) is rounded out with a brief reference
to the temptation of Jesus and how Satan's attack fails. Jesus as Son of God
will be victorious, a point to be remembered as one reads of Jesus' death and
the enigmatic ending to Mark's Gospel.
The key verses at
⇒
 Mark 1:14-15, which are programmatic, summarize
what Jesus proclaims as gospel: fulfillment, the nearness of the kingdom, and
therefore the need for repentance and for faith. After the call of the first
four disciples, all fishermen (
⇒
 Mark 1:16-20), we
see Jesus engaged in teaching (
⇒
 Mark 1:21,
⇒
 22, 
⇒
 27), preaching
(
⇒
 Mark 1:38, 
⇒
 39), and
healing (
⇒
 Mark 1:29-31,
⇒
 34, 
⇒
 40-45), and
exorcising demons (1, 22-27.34.39). The content of Jesus' teaching is only
rarely stated, and then chiefly in parables (Mark 4) about the kingdom. His
cures, especially on the sabbath (
⇒
 Mark 3:1-5); his
claim, like God, to forgive sins (
⇒
 Mark 2:3-12); his
table fellowship with tax collectors and sinners (
⇒
2:14-17); and the statement that his followers need not now fast but
should rejoice while Jesus is present (
⇒
2:18-22), all stir up opposition that will lead to Jesus' death
(
⇒
 Mark 3:6).
In Mark, Jesus is portrayed
as immensely popular with the people in Galilee during his ministry
(
⇒
 Mark 2:2; 
⇒
 3:7;
⇒
 4:1). He appoints twelve disciples to help preach and
drive out demons, just as he does (
⇒
 Mark 3:13-19).
He continues to work many miracles; the blocks 
⇒
4:35-
⇒
 6:44 and 
⇒
6:45-
⇒
 7:10 are cycles of stories about
healings, miracles at the Sea of Galilee, and marvelous feedings of the crowds.
Jesus' teaching in Mark 7 exalts the word of God over "the tradition of
the elders" and sees defilement as a matter of the heart, not of unclean
foods. Yet opposition mounts. Scribes charge that Jesus is possessed by
Beelzebul (
⇒
 Mark 3:22). His relatives think him
"out of his mind" (
⇒
 Mark 3:21). Jesus'
kinship is with those who do the will of God, in a new eschatological family,
not even with mother, brothers, or sisters by blood ties
(
⇒
 Mark 3:31-35; cf 
⇒
6:1-6). But all too often his own disciples do not understand Jesus
(
⇒
 Mark 4:13, 
⇒
 40;
⇒
 6:52; 
⇒
 8:17-21). The
fate of John the Baptist (
⇒
 Mark 6:17-29) hints
ominously at Jesus' own passion (
⇒
 Mark 9:13; cf
⇒
 Mark 8:31).
A breakthrough seemingly
comes with, Peter's confession that Jesus is the Christ (Messiah;
⇒
 Mark 8:27-30). But Jesus himself emphasizes his
passion (
⇒
 Mark 8:31;
⇒
 9:31; 
⇒
 10:33-34), not
glory in the kingdom (
⇒
 Mark 10:35-45). Momentarily
he is glimpsed in his true identity when he is transfigured before three of the
disciples (
⇒
 Mark 9:2-8), but by and large Jesus is
depicted in Mark as moving obediently along the way to his cross in Jerusalem.
Occasionally there are miracles (
⇒
 Mark 9:17-27;
⇒
 10:46-52; 
⇒
 11:12-14,
⇒
 20-21, the only such account in Jerusalem),
sometimes teachings (
⇒
 Mark 10:2-11,
⇒
 23-31), but the greatest concern is with
discipleship (
⇒
8:34-
⇒
 9:1;
⇒
 9:33-50). For the disciples do not grasp the
mystery being revealed (
⇒
 Mark 9:32;
⇒
 10:32, 
⇒
 38). One of
them will betray him, Judas (
⇒
 Mark 14:10-11,
⇒
 43-45); one will deny him, Peter
(
⇒
 Mark 14:27, 
⇒
 31,
⇒
 54, 
⇒
 66-72); all
eleven men will desert Jesus (
⇒
 Mark 14:27,
⇒
 50).
The passion account, with
its condemnation of Jesus by the Sanhedrin (
⇒
14:53, 
⇒
 55-65;
⇒
 15:1a) and sentencing by Pilate
(
⇒
 Mark 15:1b-15), is prefaced with the entry into
Jerusalem (
⇒
 Mark 11:1-11), ministry and
controversies there (
⇒
11:15-
⇒
 12:44), Jesus' Last Supper with
the disciples (
⇒
 Mark 14:1-26), and his arrest at
Gethsemane (
⇒
 Mark 14:32-52). A chapter of
apocalyptic tone about the destruction of the temple (
⇒
13:1-2, 
⇒
 14-23) and the coming of the Son
of Man (
⇒
 Mark 13:24-27), a discourse filled with
promises (
⇒
 Mark 13:11,
⇒
 31) and admonitions to be watchful
(
⇒
 Mark 13:2, 
⇒
 23,
⇒
 37), is significant for Mark's Gospel, for it
helps one see that God, in Jesus, will be victorious after the cross and at the
end of history.
The Gospel of Mark ends in
the most ancient manuscripts with an abrupt scene at Jesus' tomb, which the
women find empty (
⇒
 Mark 16:1-8). His own prophecy
of 
⇒
 Mark 14:28 is reiterated, that Jesus goes
before the disciples into Galilee; "there you will see him." These
words may imply resurrection appearances there, or Jesus' parousia there, or
the start of Christian mission, or a return to the roots depicted in
⇒
 Mark 1:9, 
⇒
 14-15 in
Galilee. Other hands have attached additional endings after
⇒
 Mark 16:8; see the note on 
⇒
16:9-20.
The framework of Mark's
Gospel is partly geographical: Galilee (Mark
1L14-
⇒
 9:49), through the area "across the
Jordan" (
⇒
 Mark 10:1) and through Jericho
(
⇒
 Mark 10:46-52), to Jerusalem
(
⇒
 Mark 11:1-
⇒
 16:8).
Only rarely does Jesus go into Gentile territory (
⇒
5:1-20; 
⇒
 7:24-37), but those who
acknowledge him there and the centurion who confesses Jesus at the cross
(
⇒
 Mark 15:39) presage the gospel's expansion into
the world beyond Palestine.
Mark's Gospel is even more
oriented to christology. Jesus is the Son of God (
⇒
1:11; 
⇒
 9:7;
⇒
 15:39; cf 
⇒
 Mark 1:1;
⇒
 14:61). He is the Messiah, the anointed king of
Davidic descent (
⇒
 Mark 12:35;
⇒
 15:32), the Greek for which, Christos, has, by
the time Mark wrote, become in effect a proper name (
⇒
1:1; 
⇒
 9:41). Jesus is also seen as Son of
Man, a term used in Mark not simply as a substitute for "I" or for
humanity in general (cf 
⇒
 Mark 2:10, 
⇒
 27-28;
⇒
 14:21) or with reference to a mighty figure who
is to come (
⇒
 Mark 13:26;
⇒
 14:62), but also in connection with Jesus'
predestined, necessary path of suffering and vindication
(
⇒
 Mark 8:31; 
⇒
 10:45).
The unfolding of Mark's
story about Jesus is sometimes viewed by interpreters as centered around the
term "mystery." The word is employed just once, at 
⇒
4:11, in the singular, and its content there is the kingdom, the open
secret that God's reign is now breaking into human life with its reversal of
human values. There is a related sense in which Jesus' real identity remained a
secret during his lifetime, according to Mark, although demons and demoniacs
knew it (
⇒
 Mark 1:24;
⇒
 3:11; 
⇒
 5:7); Jesus
warned against telling of his mighty deeds and revealing his identity
(
⇒
 Mark 1:44; 
⇒
 3:12;
⇒
 5:43; 
⇒
 7:36;
⇒
 8:26, 
⇒
 30), an
injunction sometimes broken (
⇒
 Mark 1:45; cf
⇒
 Mark 5:19-20). Further, Jesus teaches by parables,
according to Mark, in such a way that those "outside" the kingdom do
not understand, but only those to whom the mystery has been granted by God.
Mark thus shares with Paul,
as well as with other parts of the New Testament, an emphasis on election
(
⇒
 Mark 13:20, 
⇒
 22)
and upon the gospel as Christ and his cross (cf 
⇒
 1 Cor
1:23). Yet in Mark the person of Jesus is also depicted with an
unaffected naturalness. He reacts to events with authentic human emotion: pity
(
⇒
 Mark 1:44), anger (
⇒
3:5), triumph (
⇒
 Mark 4:40), sympathy
(
⇒
 Mark 5:36; 
⇒
 6:34),
surprise (
⇒
 Mark 6:9), admiration
(
⇒
 Mark 7:29; 
⇒
 10:21),
sadness (
⇒
 Mark 14:33-34), and indignation
(
⇒
 Mark 14:48-49).
Although the book is
anonymous, apart from the ancient heading "According to Mark" in
manuscripts, it has traditionally been assigned to John Mark, in whose mother's
house (at Jerusalem) Christians assembled (
⇒
 Acts
12:12). This Mark was a cousin of Barnabas (
⇒
 Col
4:10) and accompanied Barnabas and Paul on a missionary journey
(
⇒
 Acts 12:25; 
⇒
 13:3;
⇒
 15:36- 39). He appears in Pauline letters
(
⇒
 2 Tim 4:11; 
⇒
 Philippians
1:24) and with Peter (
⇒
 1 Peter 5:13).
Papias (ca. A.D. 135) described Mark as Peter's "interpreter," a view
found in other patristic writers. Petrine influence should not, however, be
exaggerated. The evangelist has put together various oral and possibly written
sources - miracle stories, parables, sayings, stories of controversies, and the
passion - so as to speak of the crucified Messiah for Mark's own day.
Traditionally, the gospel
is said to have been written shortly before A.D. 70 in Rome, at a time of
impending persecution and when destruction loomed over Jerusalem. Its audience
seems to have been Gentile, unfamiliar with Jewish customs (hence
⇒
 Mark 7:3-4, 
⇒
 11). The
book aimed to equip such Christians to stand faithful in the face of
persecution (
⇒
 Mark 13:9-13), while going on with
the proclamation of the gospel begun in Galilee (
⇒
13:10; 
⇒
 14:9). Modern research often
proposes as the author an unknown Hellenistic Jewish Christian, possibly in
Syria, and perhaps shortly after the year 70.
The principal divisions of
the Gospel according to Mark are the following:
I.          
The
Preparation for the Public Ministry of Jesus (
⇒
1:1-13) 
II.          
The
Mystery of Jesus (
⇒
1:14-
⇒
 8:26) 
III.          
The
Mystery Begins to Be Revealed (
⇒
8:27-
⇒
 9:32) 
IV.          
The
Full Revelation of the Mystery (
⇒
9:33-
⇒
 16:8)
The Longer Ending (
⇒
 Mark 16:9-20)
The Shorter Ending
The Freer Logion (in the note on 
⇒
16:9-20)
