 As he was making his way out of the temple
area one of his disciples said to him, "Look, teacher, what stones and
what buildings!" 
2
Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great
buildings? There will not be one stone left upon another that will not be
thrown down." 
3
[2]
 As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives
opposite the temple area, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, 
4
"Tell us, when will this happen, and what
sign will there be when all these things are about to come to an end?" 
5
Jesus began to say to them, "See that no
one deceives you. 
6
Many will come in my name saying, 'I am he,'
and they will deceive many. 
7
When you hear of wars and reports of wars do
not be alarmed; such things must happen, but it will not yet be the end. 
8
Nation will rise against nation and kingdom
against kingdom. There will be earthquakes from place to place and there will
be famines. These are the beginnings of the labor pains. 
9
"Watch out for yourselves. They will hand
you over to the courts. You will be beaten in synagogues. You will be arraigned
before governors and kings because of me, as a witness before them. 
10
But the gospel must first be preached to all
nations. 
[3]
11
When they lead you away and hand you over, do
not worry beforehand about what you are to say. But say whatever will be given
to you at that hour. For it will not be you who are speaking but the holy
Spirit. 
12
Brother will hand over brother to death, and
the father his child; children will rise up against parents and have them put
to death. 
13
You will be hated by all because of my name.
But the one who perseveres to the end will be saved. 
14
"When you see the desolating abomination
standing 
[4]
 where he should not (let the reader understand),
then those in Judea must flee to the mountains, 
15
(and) a person on a housetop must not go down
or enter to get anything out of his house, 
16
and a person in a field must not return to get
his cloak. 
17
Woe to pregnant women and nursing mothers in
those days. 
18
Pray that this does not happen in winter. 
19
For those times will have tribulation such as
has not been since the beginning of God's creation until now, nor ever will be.
20
If the Lord had not shortened those days, no
one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect whom he chose, he did shorten
the days. 
21
If anyone says to you then, 'Look, here is the
Messiah! Look, there he is!' do not believe it. 
22
False messiahs and false prophets will arise
and will perform signs and wonders in order to mislead, if that were possible,
the elect. 
23
Be watchful! I have told it all to you
beforehand. 
24
"But in those days after that tribulation
the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, 
25
and the stars will be falling from the sky, and
the powers in the heavens will be shaken. 
26
[5]
 And then they will see 'the Son of Man coming
in the clouds' with great power and glory, 
27
and then he will send out the angels and gather
(his) elect from the four winds, from the end of the earth to the end of the
sky. 
28
"Learn a lesson from the fig tree. When
its branch becomes tender and sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near. 
29
In the same way, when you see these things
happening, know that he is near, at the gates. 
30
Amen, I say to you, this generation will not
pass away until all these things have taken place. 
31
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words
will not pass away. 
32
"But of that day or hour, no one knows,
neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. 
33
Be watchful! Be alert! You do not know when the
time will come. 
34
It is like a man traveling abroad. He leaves
home and places his servants in charge, each with his work, and orders the
gatekeeper to be on the watch. 
35
Watch, therefore; you do not know when the lord
of the house is coming, whether in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow,
or in the morning. 
36
May he not come suddenly and find you sleeping.
37
What I say to you, I say to all: 'Watch!'"

 [1-2] The reconstructed temple with
its precincts, begun under Herod the Great ca. 20 B.C., was completed only some
seven years before it was destroyed by fire in A.D. 70 at the hands of the
Romans; cf 
⇒
 Jeremiah 26:18;
⇒
 Matthew 24:1-2. For the dating of the
reconstruction of the temple, see further the note on 
⇒
 John
2:20. 
2
 [3-37] Jesus' prediction of the
destruction of the temple (
⇒
 Mark 13:2) provoked
questions that the four named disciples put to him in private regarding the
time and the sign when all these things are about to come to an end
(
⇒
 Mark 13:3-4). The response to their questions was
Jesus' eschatological discourse prior to his imminent death. It contained
instruction and consolation exhorting the disciples and the church to faith and
obedience through the trials that would confront them (
⇒
13:5-13). The sign is the presence of the desolating abomination
(
⇒
 Mark 13:14; see 
⇒
 Daniel
9:27), i.e., of the Roman power profaning the temple. Flight from
Jerusalem is urged rather than defense of the city through misguided messianic
hope (
⇒
 Mark 13:14-23). Intervention will occur
only after destruction (
⇒
 Mark 13:24-27), which
will happen before the end of the first Christian generation
(
⇒
 Mark 13:28-31). No one but the Father knows the
precise time, or that of the parousia (
⇒
13:32); hence the necessity of constant vigilance
(
⇒
 Mark 13:33-37). Luke sets the parousia at a
later date, after "the time of the Gentiles"
(
⇒
 Luke 21:24). See also the notes on 
⇒
 Matthew
24:1-
⇒
 25:46.

 [10] The gospel . . . to all
nations: the period of the Christian mission.
4
 [14] The participle standing is
masculine, in contrast to the neuter at 
⇒
 Matthew
24:15.
5
 [26] Son of Man . . . with great
power and glory: Jesus cites this text from 
⇒
 Daniel
7:13 in his response to the high priest, Are you the Messiah? (
⇒
14:61). In
⇒
 Exodus 34:5; 
⇒
 Lev
16:2; and 
⇒
 Numbers 11:25 the clouds
indicate the presence of the divinity. Thus in his role of Son of Man, Jesus is
a heavenly being who will come in power and glory.
