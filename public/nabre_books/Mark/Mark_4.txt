[1]
 On another occasion he began to teach by the
sea. 
[2]
 A very large crowd gathered around him so that he got
into a boat on the sea and sat down. And the whole crowd was beside the sea on
land. 
2
And he taught them at length in parables, and
in the course of his instruction he said to them, 
3
[3]
 "Hear this! A sower went out to sow. 
4
And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path,
and the birds came and ate it up. 
5
Other seed fell on rocky ground where it had
little soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep. 
6
And when the sun rose, it was scorched and it
withered for lack of roots. 
7
Some seed fell among thorns, and the thorns
grew up and choked it and it produced no grain. 
8
And some seed fell on rich soil and produced
fruit. It came up and grew and yielded thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold." 
9
He added, "Whoever has ears to hear ought
to hear." 
10
And when he was alone, those present along with
the Twelve questioned him about the parables. 
11
[4]
 He answered them, "The mystery of the
kingdom of God has been granted to you. But to those outside everything comes
in parables, 
12
so that 'they may look and see but not
perceive, and hear and listen but not understand, in order that they may not be
converted and be forgiven.'" 
13
[5]
 Jesus said to them, "Do you not understand
this parable? Then how will you understand any of the parables? 
14
The sower sows the word. 
15
These are the ones on the path where the word
is sown. As soon as they hear, Satan comes at once and takes away the word sown
in them. 
16
And these are the ones sown on rocky ground
who, when they hear the word, receive it at once with joy. 
17
But they have no root; they last only for a
time. Then when tribulation or persecution comes because of the word, they
quickly fall away. 
18
Those sown among thorns are another sort. They
are the people who hear the word, 
19
but worldly anxiety, the lure of riches, and
the craving for other things intrude and choke the word, and it bears no fruit.
20
But those sown on rich soil are the ones who
hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirty and sixty and a
hundredfold." 
21
He said to them, "Is a lamp brought in to
be placed under a bushel basket or under a bed, and not to be placed on a
lampstand? 
22
For there is nothing hidden except to be made
visible; nothing is secret except to come to light. 
23
Anyone who has ears to hear ought to
hear." 
24
He also told them, "Take care what you
hear. The measure with which you measure will be measured out to you, and still
more will be given to you. 
25
To the one who has, more will be given; from
the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away." 
26
He said,"This is how it is with the
kingdom of God; 
[6]
 it is as if a man were to scatter seed on
the land 
27
and would sleep and rise night and day and the
seed would sprout and grow, he knows not how. 
28
Of its own accord the land yields fruit, first
the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. 
29
And when the grain is ripe, he wields the
sickle at once, for the harvest has come." 
30
He said, "To what shall we compare the
kingdom of God, or what parable can we use for it? 
31
It is like a mustard seed that, when it is sown
in the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on the earth. 
32
[7]
 But once it is sown, it springs up and becomes
the largest of plants and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the
sky can dwell in its shade." 
33
With many such parables he spoke the word to
them as they were able to understand it. 
34
Without parables he did not speak to them, but
to his own disciples he explained everything in private. 
35
[8]
 On that day, as evening drew on, he said to
them, "Let us cross to the other side." 
36
Leaving the crowd, they took him with them in
the boat just as he was. And other boats were with him. 
37
A violent squall came up and waves were
breaking over the boat, so that it was already filling up. 
38
Jesus was in the stern, asleep on a cushion.
They woke him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care that we are
perishing?" 
39
He woke up, rebuked the wind, and said to the
sea, "Quiet! Be still!" 
[9]
 The wind ceased and
there was great calm. 
40
Then he asked them, "Why are you
terrified? Do you not yet have faith?" 
41
[10]
 They were filled with great awe and said to
one another, "Who then is this whom even wind and sea obey?"

 [1-34] In parables (2): see the
note on 
⇒
 Matthew 13:3. The use of parables is
typical of Jesus' enigmatic method of teaching the crowds
(
⇒
 Mark 4:2-9, 
⇒
 12) as
compared with the interpretation of the parables he gives to his disciples
(
⇒
 Mark 4:10-25, 
⇒
 33-34)
to each group according to its capacity to understand (
⇒
4:9-11). The key feature of the parable at hand is the sowing of the
seed (3), representing the breakthrough of the kingdom of God into the world.
The various types of soil refer to the diversity of response accorded the word
of God (
⇒
 Mark 4:4-7). The climax of the parable is
the harvest of thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold, indicating the consummation of
the kingdom (
⇒
 Mark 4:8). Thus both the present and
the future action of God, from the initiation to the fulfillment of the
kingdom, is presented through this and other parables (
⇒
4:26-29, 
⇒
 30-32).

 [1] By the sea: the shore of the
Sea of Galilee or a boat near the shore (
⇒
2:13; 
⇒
 3:7-8) is the place where Mark
depicts Jesus teaching the crowds. By contrast the mountain is the scene of
Jesus at prayer (
⇒
 Mark 6:46) or in the process of
forming his disciples (
⇒
 Mark 3:13; 
⇒
 9:2).
3
 [3-8] See the note on
⇒
 Matthew 13:3-8.
4
 [11-12] These verses are to be
viewed against their background in 
⇒
 Mark 3:6,
⇒
 22 concerning the unbelief and opposition Jesus
encountered in his ministry. It is against this background that the distinction
in Jesus' method becomes clear of presenting the kingdom to the disbelieving
crowd in one manner and to the disciples in another. To the former it is
presented in parables and the truth remains hidden; for the latter the parable
is interpreted and the mystery is partially revealed because of their faith;
see the notes on 
⇒
 Matthew 13:11 and 
⇒
 Matthew
13:13.

 [13-20] See the note on

 Matthew 13:18-23.

 [26-29] Only Mark records the
parable of the seed's growth. Sower and harvester are the same. The emphasis is
on the power of the seed to grow of itself without human intervention
(
⇒
 Mark 4:27). Mysteriously it produces blade and
ear and full grain (
⇒
 Mark 4:28). Thus the kingdom
of God initiated by Jesus in proclaiming the word develops quietly yet
powerfully until it is fully established by him at the final judgment
(
⇒
 Mark 4:29); cf 
⇒
 Rev
14:15.
7
 [32] The universality of the
kingdom of God is indicated here; cf 
⇒
 Ezekiel
17:23; 
⇒
 31:6; 
⇒
 Daniel
4:17-19.

[
⇒
 4:35-
⇒
 5:43] After the
chapter on parables, Mark narrates four miracle stories:
⇒
 Mark 4:35-41; 
⇒
 5:1-20;
and two joined together in 
⇒
 Mark 5:21-43. See also
the notes on 
⇒
 Matthew 8:23-34 and 
⇒
 9:8-26.

 [39] Quiet! Be still!: as in the case of silencing a demon
(
⇒
 Mark 1:25), Jesus rebukes the wind and subdues
the turbulence of the sea by a mere word; see the note on
⇒
 Matthew 8:26.

 [41] Jesus is here depicted as
exercising power over wind and sea. In the Christian community this event was
seen as a sign of Jesus' saving presence amid persecutions that threatened its
existence.
