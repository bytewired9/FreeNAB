[1]
 In those days when there again was a great
crowd without anything to eat, he summoned the disciples and said, 
2
"My heart is moved with pity for the
crowd, because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to
eat. 
3
If I send them away hungry to their homes, they
will collapse on the way, and some of them have come a great distance." 
4
His disciples answered him, "Where can
anyone get enough bread to satisfy them here in this deserted place?" 
5
Still he asked them, "How many loaves do
you have?" "Seven," they replied. 
6
[2]
 He ordered the crowd to sit down on the
ground. Then, taking the seven loaves he gave thanks, broke them, and gave them
to his disciples to distribute, and they distributed them to the crowd. 
7
They also had a few fish. He said the blessing
over them and ordered them distributed also. 
8
They ate and were satisfied. They picked up the
fragments left over - seven baskets. 
9
There were about four thousand people. He
dismissed them 
10
and got into the boat with his disciples and
came to the region of Dalmanutha. 
11
[3]
 The Pharisees came forward and began to argue
with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him. 
12
He sighed from the depth of his spirit and
said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Amen, I say to you, no sign
will be given to this generation." 
13
Then he left them, got into the boat again, and
went off to the other shore. 
14
They had forgotten to bring bread, and they had
only one loaf with them in the boat. 
15
[4]
 He enjoined them, "Watch out, guard
against the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod." 
16
They concluded among themselves that it was
because they had no bread. 
17
When he became aware of this he said to them,
"Why do you conclude that it is because you have no bread? Do you not yet
understand or comprehend? Are your hearts hardened? 
18
Do you have eyes and not see, ears and not
hear? And do you not remember, 
19
when I broke the five loaves for the five
thousand, how many wicker baskets full of fragments you picked up?" They
answered him, "Twelve." 
20
"When I broke the seven loaves for the four
thousand, how many full baskets of fragments did you pick up?" They
answered (him), "Seven." 
21
He said to them, "Do you still not
understand?" 
22
[5]
 When they arrived at Bethsaida, they brought
to him a blind man and begged him to touch him. 
23
He took the blind man by the hand and led him
outside the village. Putting spittle on his eyes he laid his hands on him and
asked, "Do you see anything?" 
24
Looking up he replied, "I see people
looking like trees and walking." 
25
Then he laid hands on his eyes a second time
and he saw clearly; his sight was restored and he could see everything
distinctly. 
26
Then he sent him home and said, "Do not
even go into the village." 
27
[6]
 Now Jesus and his disciples set out for the
villages of Caesarea Philippi. Along the way he asked his disciples, "Who
do people say that I am?" 
28
They said in reply, "John the Baptist,
others Elijah, still others one of the prophets." 
29
And he asked them, "But who do you say
that I am?" Peter said to him in reply, "You are the Messiah." 
30
Then he warned them not to tell anyone about
him. 
31
He began to teach them that the Son of Man 
[7]
must suffer greatly and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the
scribes, and be killed, and rise after three days. 
32
He spoke this openly. Then Peter took him aside
and began to rebuke him. 
33
At this he turned around and, looking at his
disciples, rebuked Peter and said, "Get behind me, Satan. You are thinking
not as God does, but as human beings do." 
34
He summoned the crowd with his disciples and
said 
[8]
 to them, "Whoever wishes to come after me must
deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. 
35
For whoever wishes to save his life will lose
it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and that of the gospel 
[9]
will save it. 
36
What profit is there for one to gain the whole
world and forfeit his life? 
37
What could one give in exchange for his life? 
38
Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in
this faithless and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of when he
comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels."

 [1-10] The two accounts of the
multiplication of loaves and fishes (
⇒
 Mark 8:1-10;
⇒
 6:31-44) have eucharistic significance. Their
similarity of structure and themes but dissimilarity of detail are considered
by many to refer to a single event that, however, developed in two distinct
traditions, one Jewish Christian and the other Gentile Christian, since Jesus
in Mark's presentation (
⇒
 Mark 7:24-37) has extended
his saving mission to the Gentiles.

⇒
 Mark 6:41.
3
 [11-12] The objection of the
Pharisees that Jesus' miracles are unsatisfactory for proving the arrival of
God's kingdom is comparable to the request of the crowd for a sign in
⇒
 John 6:30-31. Jesus' response shows that a sign
originating in human demand will not be provided; cf 
⇒
 Numbers
14:11, 
⇒
 22.

 [15] The leaven of the Pharisees .
. . of Herod: the corruptive action of leaven (
⇒
 1 Cor
5:6-8; 
⇒
 Gal 5:9) was an apt symbol of the
evil dispositions both of the Pharisees (
⇒
8:11-13; 
⇒
 7:5-13) and of Herod
(
⇒
 Mark 6:14-29) toward Jesus. The disciples of
Jesus are warned against sharing such rebellious attitudes toward Jesus; cf
⇒
 Mark 8:17, 
⇒
 21.
5
 [22-26] Jesus' actions and the
gradual cure of the blind man probably have the same purpose as in the case of
the deaf man (
⇒
 Mark 7:31-37). Some commentators
regard the cure as an intended symbol of the gradual enlightenment of the
disciples concerning Jesus' messiahship.
6
 [27-30] This episode is the turning
point in Mark's account of Jesus in his public ministry. Popular opinions
concur in regarding him as a prophet. The disciples by contrast believe him to
be the Messiah. Jesus acknowledges this identification but prohibits them from
making his messianic office known to avoid confusing it with ambiguous
contemporary ideas on the nature of that office. See further the notes on
⇒
 Matthew 16:13-20.

 [31] Son of Man: an enigmatic
title. It is used in 
⇒
 Daniel 7:13-14 has a symbol
of "the saints of the Most High," the faithful Israelites who receive
the everlasting kingdom from the Ancient One (God). They are represented by a
human figure that contrasts with the various beasts who represent the previous
kingdoms of the earth. In the Jewish apocryphal books of 1 Enoch and 4 Ezra the
"Son of Man" is not, as in Daniel, a group, but a unique figure of
extraordinary spiritual endowments, who will be revealed as the one through
whom the everlasting kingdom decreed by God will be established. It is possible
though doubtful that this individualization of the Son of Man figure had been
made in Jesus' time, and therefore his use of the title in that sense is
questionable. Of itself, this expression means simply a human being, or,
indefinitely, someone, and there are evidences of this use in pre-Christian
times. Its use in the New Testament is probably due to Jesus' speaking of
himself in that way, "a human being," and the later church's taking
this in the sense of the Jewish apocrypha and applying it to him with that
meaning. Rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes: the
supreme council called the Sanhedrin was made up of seventy-one members of
these three groups and presided over by the high priest. It exercised authority
over the Jews in religious matters. See the note on 
⇒
 Matthew
8:20.
8
 [34-35] This utterance of Jesus
challenges all believers to authentic discipleship and total commitment to
himself through self-renunciation and acceptance of the cross of suffering,
even to the sacrifice of life itself. Whoever wishes to save his life will lose
it . . . will save it: an expression of the ambivalence of life and its
contrasting destiny. Life seen as mere self-centered earthly existence and
lived in denial of Christ ends in destruction, but when lived in loyalty to
Christ, despite earthly death, it arrives at fullness of life.
