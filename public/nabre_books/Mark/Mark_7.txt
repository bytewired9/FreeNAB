[1]
 Now when the Pharisees with some scribes who
had come from Jerusalem gathered around him, 
2
they observed that some of his disciples ate
their meals with unclean, that is, unwashed, hands. 
3
(For the Pharisees and, in fact, all Jews, do
not eat without carefully washing their hands, 
[2]
 keeping the
tradition of the elders. 
4
And on coming from the marketplace they do not
eat without purifying themselves. And there are many other things that they
have traditionally observed, the purification of cups and jugs and kettles (and
beds).) 
5
So the Pharisees and scribes questioned him,
"Why do your disciples not follow the tradition of the elders 
[3]
but instead eat a meal with unclean hands?" 
6
He responded, "Well did Isaiah prophesy
about you hypocrites, as it is written: 'This people honors me with their lips,
but their hearts are far from me; 
7
In vain do they worship me, teaching as
doctrines human precepts.' 
8
You disregard God's commandment but cling to
human tradition." 
9
He went on to say, "How well you have set
aside the commandment of God in order to uphold your tradition! 
10
For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your
mother,' and 'Whoever curses father or mother shall die.' 
11
Yet you say, 'If a person says to father or
mother, "Any support you might have had from me is qorban"' 
[4]
(meaning, dedicated to God), 
12
you allow him to do nothing more for his father
or mother. 
13
You nullify the word of God in favor of your
tradition that you have handed on. And you do many such things." 
14
He summoned the crowd again and said to them,
"Hear me, all of you, and understand. 
15
Nothing that enters one from outside can defile
that person; but the things that come out from within are what defile." 
16
) 
[5]
17
[6]
 When he got home away from the crowd his
disciples questioned him about the parable. 
18
He said to them, "Are even you likewise
without understanding? Do you not realize that everything that goes into a
person from outside cannot defile, 
19
[7]
 since it enters not the heart but the stomach
and passes out into the latrine?" (Thus he declared all foods clean.) 
20
"But what comes out of a person, that is
what defiles. 
21
From within people, from their hearts, come
evil thoughts, unchastity, theft, murder, 
22
adultery, greed, malice, deceit,
licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, folly. 
23
All these evils come from within and they
defile." 
24
From that place he went off to the district of
Tyre. 
[8]
 He entered a house and wanted no one to know about
it, but he could not escape notice. 
25
Soon a woman whose daughter had an unclean
spirit heard about him. She came and fell at his feet. 
26
The woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by
birth, and she begged him to drive the demon out of her daughter. 
27
He said to her, "Let the children be fed
first. 
[9]
 For it is not right to take the food of the
children and throw it to the dogs." 
28
She replied and said to him, "Lord, even
the dogs under the table eat the children's scraps." 
29
Then he said to her, "For saying this, you
may go. The demon has gone out of your daughter." 
30
When the woman went home, she found the child
lying in bed and the demon gone. 
31
Again he left the district of Tyre and went by
way of Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, into the district of the Decapolis. 
32
And people brought to him a deaf man who had a
speech impediment and begged him to lay his hand on him. 
33
He took him off by himself away from the crowd.
He put his finger into the man's ears and, spitting, touched his tongue; 
34
then he looked up to heaven and groaned, and
said to him, "Ephphatha!" (that is, "Be opened!") 
35
And (immediately) the man's ears were opened,
his speech impediment was removed, and he spoke plainly. 
36
[10]
 He ordered them not to tell anyone. But the
more he ordered them not to, the more they proclaimed it. 
37
They were exceedingly astonished and they said,
"He has done all things well. He makes the deaf hear and (the) mute
speak."

 [1-23] See the note on
⇒
 Matthew 15:1-20. Against the Pharisees' narrow,
legalistic, and external practices of piety in matters of purification
(
⇒
 Mark 7:2-5), external worship
(
⇒
 Mark 7:6-7), and observance of commandments, Jesus
sets in opposition the true moral intent of the divine law (
⇒
7:8-13). But he goes beyond contrasting the law and Pharisaic
interpretation of it. The parable of 
⇒
 Mark 7:14-15
in effect sets aside the law itself in respect to clean and unclean food. He
thereby opens the way for unity between Jew and Gentile in the kingdom of God,
intimated by Jesus' departure for pagan territory beyond Galilee. For similar
contrast see 
⇒
2:1-
⇒
 3:6; 
⇒
 3:20-35;
⇒
 6:1-6. 
2
 [3] Carefully washing their hands:
refers to ritual purification.
3
 [5] Tradition of the elders: the
body of detailed, unwritten, human laws regarded by the scribes and Pharisees
to have the same binding force as that of the Mosaic law; cf
⇒
 Gal 1:14.
4
 [11] Qorban: a formula for a gift
to God, dedicating the offering to the temple, so that the giver might continue
to use it for himself but not give it to others, even needy parents.

 [16] 
⇒
7:16, "Anyone who has ears to hear ought to hear," is
omitted because it is lacking in some of the best Greek manuscripts and was
probably transferred here by scribes from 
⇒
 Mark 4:9,

 23.
6
 [17] Away from the crowd . . . the
parable: in this context of privacy the term parable refers to something
hidden, about to be revealed to the disciples; cf 
⇒
4:10-11.34. Jesus sets the Mosaic food laws in the context of the
kingdom of God where they are abrogated, and he declares moral defilement the
only cause of uncleanness.
7
 [19] (Thus he declared all foods
clean): if this bold declaration goes back to Jesus, its force was not realized
among Jewish Christians in the early church; cf 
⇒
 Acts
10:1-
⇒
 11:18.
8
 [24-37] The withdrawal of Jesus to
the district of Tyre may have been for a respite (
⇒
7:24), but he soon moved onward to Sidon and, by way of the Sea of
Galilee, to the Decapolis. These districts provided a Gentile setting for the
extension of his ministry of healing because the people there acknowledged his
power (
⇒
 Mark 7:29,
⇒
 37). The actions attributed to Jesus
(
⇒
 Mark 7:33-35) were also used by healers of the
time.
9
 [27-28] The figure of a household
in which children at table are fed first and then their leftover food is given
to the dogs under the table is used effectively to acknowledge the prior claim
of the Jews to the ministry of Jesus; however, Jesus accedes to the Gentile
woman's plea for the cure of her afflicted daughter because of her faith.
10
 [36] The more they proclaimed it:
the same verb proclaim attributed here to the crowd in relation to the miracles
of Jesus is elsewhere used in Mark for the preaching of the gospel on the part
of Jesus, of his disciples, and of the Christian community
(
⇒
 Mark 1:14; 
⇒
 13:10;
⇒
 14:9). Implied in the action of the crowd is a
recognition of the salvific mission of Jesus; see the note on
⇒
 Matthew 11:5-6.
