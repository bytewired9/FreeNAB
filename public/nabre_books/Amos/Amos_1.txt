[1]
 The words of Amos, a shepherd from Tekoa,
which he received in vision concerning Israel, in the days of Uzziah, king of
Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, son of Joash, king of Israel, two years
before the earthquake: 
2
The LORD will roar from Zion, and from
Jerusalem raise his voice: The pastures of the shepherds will languish, and the
summit of Carmel wither. 
3
[2]
 Thus says the LORD: For three crimes of
Damascus, and for four, I will not revoke my word; Because they threshed Gilead
with sledges of iron, 
4
[3]
 I will send fire upon the house of Hazael, to
devour the castles of Ben-hadad. 
5
[4]
 I will break the bar of Damascus; I will root
out those who live in the Valley of Aven, And the sceptered ruler of Beth-eden;
the people of Aram shall be exiled to Kir, says the LORD. 
6
Thus says the LORD: For three crimes of Gaza,
and for four, I will not revoke my word; Because they took captive whole groups
to hand over to Edom, 
7
I will send fire upon the wall of Gaza, to
devour her castles; 
8
I will root out those who live in Ashdod, and
the sceptered ruler of Ashkelon; I will turn my hand against Ekron, and the
last of the Philistines shall perish, says the Lord God. 
9
[5]
 Thus says the LORD: For three crimes of Tyre,
and for four I will not revoke my word; Because they delivered whole groups
captive to Edom, and did not remember the pact of brotherhood, 
10
I will send fire upon the wall of Tyre,to
devour her castles. 
11
[6]
 Thus says the LORD: For three crimes of Edom,
and for four, I will not revoke my word; Because he pursued his brother with
the sword, choking up all pity; Because he persisted in his anger and kept his
wrath to the end, 
12
[7]
 I will send fire upon Teman, and it will
devour the castles of Bozrah. 
13
Thus says the LORD: For three crimes of the
Ammonites, and for four, I will not revoke my word; Because they ripped open
expectant mothers in Gilead, while extending their territory, 
14
[8]
 I will kindle a fire upon the wall of Rabbah,
and it will devour her castles Amid clamor on the day of battle and stormwind
in a time of tempest. 
15
Their king shall go into captivity, he and his
princes with him, says the LORD.

to Hebrew tradition marked the crime of Uzziah when he attempted to offer
incense in the temple (

Zechariah mentions it several centuries later (
⇒
 Zechariah
14:5). 
2
 [3] For three crimes . . . four:
crime after crime, an indefinite number; cf 
⇒
1:6. The series of judgments on the foreign nations shows that the
Lord demands the observance of the moral order everywhere; Israel and Judah,
despite their privileged position, are no exception. I will not revoke my word:
God will not withdraw his threat of punishment against each of these nations.
They threshed Gilead: the people of Aram under King Hazael had devastated
Gilead; cf 
⇒
 2 Kings 10:32-33.

 [4] Fire: devastation caused by the
Assyrians (
⇒
 Amos 1:7,

Hazael and Ben-hadad: kings of the Arameans whose captial was Damascus
(

of Gilead (

 Amos 1:3) in Transjordan.

securing the main gate of the city against invaders, symbol of its defenses.
Valley of Aven ("vale of wickedness") and Beth-eden ("house of

 [9] Pact of brotherhood: Hiram of
Tyre had made a pact with Solomon and called him brother (
⇒
 1
Kings 5:12; 
⇒
 9:13).
6

Edomites were descended from Esau, the brother of Jacob (Genesis 25-27);
nevertheless they constantly nourished enmity against Jacob's descendants, the
Israelites.
7
 [12] Teman and Bozrah: two of the
