[1]
 Thus says the LORD: For three crimes of Moab,
and for four, I will not revoke my word; Because he burned to ashes the bones
of Edom's king, 
2
I will send fire upon Moab, to devour the
castles of Kerioth; Moab shall meet death amid uproar and shouts and trumpet
blasts. 
3
I will root out the judge from her midst, and
her princes I will slay with him, says the LORD. 
4
[2]
 Thus says the LORD: For three crimes of Judah,
and for four, I will not revoke my word; Because they spurned the law of the
LORD, and did not keep his statutes; Because the lies which their fathers
followed have led them astray, 
5
I will send fire upon Judah, to devour the
castles of Jerusalem. 
6
[3]
[4]
 Thus says the LORD: For
three crimes of Israel, and for four, I will not revoke my word; Because they
sell the just man for silver, and the poor man for a pair of sandals. 
7
They trample the heads of the weak into the
dust of the earth, and force the lowly out of the way. Son and father go to the
same prostitute, profaning my holy name. 
8
[5]
 Upon garments taken in pledge they recline
beside any altar; And the wine of those who have been fined they drink in the
house of their god. 
9
Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorites before
them, who were as tall as the cedars, and as strong as the oak trees. I
destroyed their fruit above, and their roots beneath. 
10
It was I who brought you up from the land of
Egypt, and who led you through the desert for forty years, to occupy the land
of the Amorites: 
11
[6]
 I who raised up prophets among your sons, and
nazirites among your young men. Is this not so, O men of Israel? says the LORD.
12
But you gave the nazirites wine to drink, and
commanded the prophets not to prophesy. 
13
Beware, I will crush you into the ground as a
wagon crushes when laden with sheaves. 
14
Flight shall perish from the swift, and the
strong man shall not retain his strength; The warrior shall not save his life, 
15
nor the bowman stand his ground; The swift of
foot shall not escape, nor the horseman save his life. 
16
And the most stouthearted of warriors shall
flee naked on that day, says the LORD. 
1
 [1] Here the prophet stresses the
gravity of Moab's violation of the Semitic custom of providing honorable burial
for the dead. 
2
 [4] The lies: false gods, who exist
only in the minds of their worshipers. The crimes of Judah are infidelity and
idolatry, in contrast to the sins for which the surrounding nations are judged.
3
 [6-13] The detailed crimes of
Israel are placed in strong contrast with the benefits with which the Lord
favored his people.
4
 [6] A pair of sandals: indicating
how cheaply the rich regarded the poor.
5
 [8] Upon garments . . . any altar:
usurers kept the garments taken as pledges from the poor; but instead of
restoring them to their owners before nightfall (
⇒
 Exodus
22:25; 
⇒
 Deut 24:12), they used them in
idolatrous worship. Wine . . . their god: under the guise of a religious
ceremony they drink the wine obtained through unjust fines.
