 "Stop judging, that
you may not be judged. 
2
For as you judge, so will you be judged, and
the measure with which you measure will be measured out to you. 
3
Why do you notice the splinter in your
brother's eye, but do not perceive the wooden beam in your own eye? 
4
How can you say to your brother, 'Let me remove
that splinter from your eye,' while the wooden beam is in your eye? 
5
You hypocrite, 
[3]
 remove the
wooden beam from your eye first; then you will see clearly to remove the
splinter from your brother's eye. 
6
"Do not give what is holy to dogs, 
[4]
or throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them underfoot, and turn
and tear you to pieces. 
7
"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and
you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 
8
For everyone who asks, receives; and the one
who seeks, finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. 
9
Which one of you would hand his son a stone
when he asks for a loaf of bread, 
[5]
10
or a snake when he asks for a fish? 
11
If you then, who are wicked, know how to give
good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good
things to those who ask him. 
12
[6]
 "Do to others whatever you would have
them do to you. This is the law and the prophets. 
13
[7]
[8]
 "Enter through the
narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the road broad that leads to destruction,
and those who enter through it are many. 
14
How narrow the gate and constricted the road
that leads to life. And those who find it are few. 
15
[9]
 "Beware of false prophets, who come to
you in sheep's clothing, but underneath are ravenous wolves. 
16
By their fruits you will know them. Do people
pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? 
17
Just so, every good tree bears good fruit, and
a rotten tree bears bad fruit. 
18
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a
rotten tree bear good fruit. 
19
Every tree that does not bear good fruit will
be cut down and thrown into the fire. 
20
So by their fruits you will know them. 
21
"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord,
Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, 
[10]
 but only the one
who does the will of my Father in heaven. 
22
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord,
did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not drive out demons in your name? Did
we not do mighty deeds in your name?' 
23
Then I will declare to them solemnly, 'I never
knew you. 
[11]
 Depart from me, you evildoers.' 
24
[12]
 "Everyone who listens to these words of
mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock. 
25
The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds
blew and buffeted the house. But it did not collapse; it had been set solidly
on rock. 
26
And everyone who listens to these words of mine
but does not act on them will be like a fool who built his house on sand. 
27
The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds
blew and buffeted the house. And it collapsed and was completely ruined." 
28
[13]
 When Jesus finished these words, the crowds
were astonished at his teaching, 
29
[14]
 for he taught them as one having authority,
and not as their scribes. 
1
 [1-12] In 
⇒
7:1 Matthew returns to the basic traditional material of the sermon
(
⇒
 Luke 6:37-38,
⇒
 41-42). The governing thought is the
correspondence between conduct toward one's fellows and God's conduct toward
the one so acting.
2
 [1] This is not a prohibition
against recognizing the faults of others, which would be hardly compatible with
⇒
 Matthew 7:5, 6 but
against passing judgment in a spirit of arrogance, forgetful of one's own
faults. 
3
 [5] Hypocrite: the designation
previously given to the scribes and Pharisees is here given to the Christian
disciple who is concerned with the faults of another and ignores his own more
serious offenses.
4
 [6] Dogs and swine were Jewish
terms of contempt for Gentiles. This saying may originally have derived from a
Jewish Christian community opposed to preaching the gospel (what is holy,
pearls) to Gentiles. In the light of 
⇒
28:19 that can hardly be Matthew's meaning. He may have taken the
saying as applying to a Christian dealing with an obstinately impenitent fellow
Christian (
⇒
 Matthew 18:17).
5
 [9-10] There is a resemblance
between a stone and a round loaf of bread and between a serpent and the
scaleless fish called barbut.
6
 [12] See 
⇒
 Luke
6:31. This saying, known since the eighteenth century as the
"Golden Rule," is found in both positive and negative form in pagan
and Jewish sources, both earlier and later than the gospel. This is the law and
the prophets is an addition probably due to the evangelist.
7
 [13-28] The final section of the
discourse is composed of a series of antitheses, contrasting two kinds of life
within the Christian community, that of those who obey the words of Jesus and
that of those who do not. Most of the sayings are from Q and are found also in
Luke.
8
 [13-14] The metaphor of the
"two ways" was common in pagan philosophy and in the Old Testament.
In Christian literature it is found also in the Didache (1-6) and the Epistle
of Barnabas (18-20).
9
 [15-20] Christian disciples who
claimed to speak in the name of God are called prophets
(
⇒
 Matthew 7:15) in 
⇒
10:41; 
⇒
 Matthew 23:34. They were
presumably an important group within the church of Matthew. As in the case of
the Old Testament prophets, there were both true and false ones, and for
Matthew the difference could be recognized by the quality of their deeds, the
fruits (
⇒
 Matthew 7:16). The mention of fruits leads
to the comparison with trees, some producing good fruit, others bad.
10
 [21-23] The attack on the false
prophets is continued, but is broadened to include those disciples who perform
works of healing and exorcism in the name of Jesus (Lord) but live evil lives.
Entrance into the kingdom is only for those who do the will of the Father. On
the day of judgment (on that day) the morally corrupt prophets and miracle
workers will be rejected by Jesus.
11
 [23] I never knew you: cf
⇒
 Matthew 10:33. Depart from me, you evildoers: cf
⇒
 Psalm 6:8.
12
 [24-27] The conclusion of the
discourse (cf 
⇒
 Luke 6:47-49). Here the relation is
not between saying and doing as in 
⇒
 Matthew 7:15-23
but between hearing and doing, and the words of Jesus are applied to every
Christian (everyone who listens).
13
 [28-29] When Jesus finished these
words: this or a similar formula is used by Matthew to conclude each of the
five great discourses of Jesus (cf 
⇒
 Matthew 11:1;
⇒
 13:53; 
⇒
 19:1;
⇒
 26:1).
14
 [29] Not as their scribes: scribal
instruction was a faithful handing down of the traditions of earlier teachers;
Jesus' teaching is based on his own authority. Their scribes: for the
implications of their, see the note on 
⇒
4:23.
