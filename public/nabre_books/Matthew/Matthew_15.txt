[1]
 Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from
Jerusalem and said, 
2
"Why do your disciples break the tradition
of the elders? 
[2]
 They do not wash (their) hands when they
eat a meal." 
3
He said to them in reply, "And why do you
break the commandment of God 
[3]
 for the sake of your
tradition? 
4
For God said, 'Honor your father and your
mother,' and 'Whoever curses father or mother shall die.' 
5
[4]
 But you say, 'Whoever says to father or
mother, "Any support you might have had from me is dedicated to God,"
6
need not honor his father.' You have nullified
the word of God for the sake of your tradition. 
7
Hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy about you
when he said: 
8
'This people honors me with their lips, 
[5]
but their hearts are far from me; 
9
in vain do they worship me, teaching as
doctrines human precepts.'" 
10
He summoned the crowd and said to them,
"Hear and understand. 
11
It is not what enters one's mouth that defiles
that person; but what comes out of the mouth is what defiles one." 
12
Then his disciples approached and said to him,
"Do you know that the Pharisees took offense when they heard what you
said?" 
13
He said in reply, 
[6]
"Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. 
14
Let them alone; they are blind guides (of the
blind). If a blind person leads a blind person, both will fall into a
pit." 
15
Then Peter 
[7]
 said to him in
reply, "Explain (this) parable to us." 
16
He said to them, "Are even you still without
understanding? 
17
Do you not realize that everything that enters
the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled into the latrine? 
18
But the things that come out of the mouth come
from the heart, and they defile. 
19
[8]
 For from the heart come evil thoughts, murder,
adultery, unchastity, theft, false witness, blasphemy. 
20
These are what defile a person, but to eat with
unwashed hands does not defile." 
21
[9]
 Then Jesus went from that place and withdrew
to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 
22
And behold, a Canaanite woman of that district
came and called out, "Have pity on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is tormented
by a demon." 
23
But he did not say a word in answer to her. His
disciples came and asked him, "Send her away, for she keeps calling out
after us." 
24
[10]
 He said in reply, "I was sent only to the
lost sheep of the house of Israel." 
25
But the woman came and did him homage, saying,
"Lord, help me." 
26
He said in reply, "It is not right to take
the food of the children 
[11]
 and throw it to the dogs." 
27
She said, "Please, Lord, for even the dogs
eat the scraps that fall from the table of their masters." 
28
Then Jesus said to her in reply, "O woman,
great is your faith! 
[12]
 Let it be done for you as you
wish." And her daughter was healed from that hour. 
29
Moving on from there Jesus walked by the Sea of
Galilee, went up on the mountain, and sat down there. 
30
Great crowds came to him, having with them the
lame, the blind, the deformed, the mute, and many others. They placed them at
his feet, and he cured them. 
31
The crowds were amazed when they saw the mute
speaking, the deformed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind able to see,
and they glorified the God of Israel. 
32
[13]
 Jesus summoned his disciples and said,
"My heart is moved with pity for the crowd, for they have been with me now
for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry,
for fear they may collapse on the way." 
33
The disciples said to him, "Where could we
ever get enough bread in this deserted place to satisfy such a crowd?" 
34
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do
you have?" "Seven," they replied, "and a few fish." 
35
He ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground.
36
Then he took the seven loaves and the fish,
gave thanks, 
[14]
 broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples,
who in turn gave them to the crowds. 
37
They all ate and were satisfied. They picked up
the fragments left over - seven baskets full. 
38
Those who ate were four thousand men, not
counting women and children. 
39
And when he had dismissed the crowds, he got
into the boat and came to the district of Magadan.

 [1-20] This dispute begins with the
question of the Pharisees and scribes why Jesus' disciples are breaking the
tradition of the elders about washing one's hands before eating
(
⇒
 Matthew 15:2). Jesus' counterquestion accuses his
opponents of breaking the commandment of God for the sake of their tradition
(
⇒
 Matthew 15:3) and illustrates this by their
interpretation of the commandment of the Decalogue concerning parents
(
⇒
 Matthew 15:4-6). Denouncing them as hypocrites,
he applies to them a derogatory prophecy of Isaiah (
⇒
15:7-8). Then with a wider audience (the crowd,
⇒
 Matthew 15:10) he goes beyond the violation of
tradition with which the dispute has started. The parable
(
⇒
 Matthew 15:11) is an attack on the Mosaic law
concerning clean and unclean foods, similar to those antitheses that abrogate
the law (
⇒
 Matthew 5:31-32,
⇒
 33-34, 
⇒
 38-39). After a
warning to his disciples not to follow the moral guidance of the Pharisees
(
⇒
 Matthew 15:13-14), he explains the parable
(
⇒
 Matthew 15:15) to them, saying that defilement
comes not from what enters the mouth (
⇒
15:17) but from the evil thoughts and deeds that rise from within,
from the heart (
⇒
 Matthew 15:18-20). The last verse
returns to the starting point of the dispute (eating with unwashed hands).
Because of Matthew's omission of 
⇒
 Mark 7:19b, some
scholars think that Matthew has weakened the Marcan repudiation of the Mosaic
food laws. But that half verse is ambiguous in the Greek, which may be the
reason for its omission here. 
2
 [2] The tradition of the elders:
see the note on 
⇒
 Mark 7:5. The purpose of the
handwashing was to remove defilement caused by contact with what was ritually
unclean.
3
 [3-4] For the commandment see
⇒
 Exodus 20:12; 
⇒
 Deut
5:16); 
⇒
 21:17. The honoring of one's
parents had to do with supporting them in their needs.
4
 [5] See the note on 
⇒
 Mark
7:11.
5
 [8] The text of
⇒
 Isaiah 29:13 is quoted approximately according to
the Septuagint.
6
 [13-14] Jesus leads his disciples
away from the teaching authority of the Pharisees.
7
 [15] Matthew specifies Peter as the
questioner, unlike 
⇒
 Mark 7:17. Given his tendency
to present the disciples as more understanding than in his Marcan source, it is
noteworthy that here he retains the Marcan rebuke, although in a slightly
milder form. This may be due to his wish to correct the Jewish Christians
within his church who still held to the food laws and thus separated themselves
from Gentile Christians who did not observe them.
8
 [19] The Marcan list of thirteen
things that defile (
⇒
 Matthew 7:21-22) is here
reduced to seven that partially cover the content of the Decalogue.
⇒
 Matthew 15:21-28: See the note on
⇒
 Matthew 8:5-13.
9
 [21-28] See the note on
⇒
 Matthew 8:5-13.
10
 [24] See the note on
⇒
 Matthew 10:5-6.
11
 [26] The children: the people of
Israel. Dogs: see the note on 
⇒
 Matthew 7:6.
12
 [28] As in the case of the cure of
the centurion's servant (
⇒
 Matthew 8:10), Matthew
ascribes Jesus' granting the request to the woman's great faith, a point not
made equally explicit in the Marcan parallel (
⇒
7:24-30).
13
 [32-39] Most probably this story is
a doublet of that of the feeding of the five thousand
(
⇒
 Matthew 14:13-21). It differs from it notably
only in that Jesus takes the initiative, not the disciples
(
⇒
 Matthew 15:32), and in the numbers: the crowd
has been with Jesus three days (
⇒
 Matthew 15:32),
seven loaves are multiplied (
⇒
 Matthew 15:36),
seven baskets of fragments remain after the feeding
(
⇒
 Matthew 15:37), and four thousand men are fed
(
⇒
 Matthew 15:38).
14
 [36] Gave thanks: see
⇒
 Matthew 14:19, "said the blessing."
There is no difference in meaning. The thanksgiving was a blessing of God for
his benefits.
