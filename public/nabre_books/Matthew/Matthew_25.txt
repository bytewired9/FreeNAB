 "Then 
[2]
 the kingdom of
heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the
bridegroom. 
2
[3]
 Five of them were foolish and five were wise. 
3
The foolish ones, when taking their lamps,
brought no oil with them, 
4
but the wise brought flasks of oil with their
lamps. 
5
Since the bridegroom was long delayed, they all
became drowsy and fell asleep. 
6
At midnight, there was a cry, 'Behold, the
bridegroom! Come out to meet him!' 
7
Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their
lamps. 
8
The foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us
some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.' 
9
But the wise ones replied, 'No, for there may
not be enough for us and you. Go instead to the merchants and buy some for
yourselves.' 
10
While they went off to buy it, the bridegroom
came and those who were ready went into the wedding feast with him. Then the
door was locked. 
11
[4]
 Afterwards the other virgins came and said,
'Lord, Lord, open the door for us!' 
12
But he said in reply, 'Amen, I say to you, I do
not know you.' 
13
Therefore, stay awake, 
[5]
 for
you know neither the day nor the hour. 
14
[6]
 "It will be as when a man who was going
on a journey 
[7]
 called in his servants and entrusted his
possessions to them. 
15
To one he gave five talents; 
[8]
to another, two; to a third, one - to each according to his ability. Then he
went away. Immediately 
16
the one who received five talents went and
traded with them, and made another five. 
17
Likewise, the one who received two made another
two. 
18
[9]
 But the man who received one went off and dug
a hole in the ground and buried his master's money. 
19
After a long time the master of those servants
came back and settled accounts with them. 
20
The one who had received five talents came forward
bringing the additional five. 
[10]
 He said, 'Master, you gave
me five talents. See, I have made five more.' 
21
His master said to him, 'Well done, my good and
faithful servant. Since you were faithful in small matters, I will give you
great responsibilities. Come, share your master's joy.' 
22
(Then) the one who had received two talents
also came forward and said, 'Master, you gave me two talents. See, I have made
two more.' 
23
His master said to him, 'Well done, my good and
faithful servant. Since you were faithful in small matters, I will give you
great responsibilities. Come, share your master's joy.' 
24
Then the one who had received the one talent
came forward and said, 'Master, I knew you were a demanding person, harvesting
where you did not plant and gathering where you did not scatter; 
25
so out of fear I went off and buried your
talent in the ground. Here it is back.' 
26
His master said to him in reply, 'You wicked,
lazy servant! 
[11]
 So you knew that I harvest where I did not
plant and gather where I did not scatter? 
27
Should you not then have put my money in the
bank so that I could have got it back with interest on my return? 
28
Now then! Take the talent from him and give it
to the one with ten. 
29
[12]
 For to everyone who has, more will be given
and he will grow rich; but from the one who has not, even what he has will be
taken away. 
30
[13]
 And throw this useless servant into the
darkness outside, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.' 
31
[14]
 "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and
all the angels with him, he will sit upon his glorious throne, 
32
and all the nations 
[15]
 will
be assembled before him. And he will separate them one from another, as a
shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 
33
He will place the sheep on his right and the
goats on his left. 
34
Then the king will say to those on his right,
'Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world. 
35
For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was
thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me, 
36
naked and you clothed me, ill and you cared for
me, in prison and you visited me.' 
37
Then the righteous 
[16]
 will
answer him and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty
and give you drink? 
38
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you,
or naked and clothe you? 
39
When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit
you?' 
40
And the king will say to them in reply, 'Amen,
I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did
for me.' 
41
[17]
 Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart
from me, you accursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his
angels. 
42
For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was
thirsty and you gave me no drink, 
43
a stranger and you gave me no welcome, naked
and you gave me no clothing, ill and in prison, and you did not care for me.' 
44
[18]
 Then they will answer and say, 'Lord, when did
we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or ill or in prison, and
not minister to your needs?' 
45
He will answer them, 'Amen, I say to you, what
you did not do for one of these least ones, you did not do for me.' 
46
And these will go off to eternal punishment,
but the righteous to eternal life." 
1
 [1-13] Peculiar to Matthew.
2
 [1] Then: at the time of the
parousia. Kingdom . . . will be like: see the note on
⇒
 Matthew 13:24-30. 
3
 [2-4] Foolish . . . wise: cf the
contrasted "wise man" and "fool" of
⇒
 Matthew 7:24, 
⇒
 26
where the two are distinguished by good deeds and lack of them, and such deeds
may be signified by the oil of this parable.
4
 [11-12] Lord, Lord: cf 
⇒
7:21. I do
not know you: cf 
⇒
 Matthew 7:23 where the Greek verb
is different but synonymous.
5
 [13] Stay awake: some scholars see
this command as an addition to the original parable of Matthew's traditional
material, since in 
⇒
 Matthew 25:5 all the virgins,
wise and foolish, fall asleep. But the wise virgins are adequately equipped for
their task, and stay awake may mean no more than to be prepared; cf 
⇒
24:42, 
⇒
 44.
6
 [14-30] Cf 
⇒
 Luke
19:12-27.
7
 [14] It will be as when . . .
journey: literally, "For just as a man who was going on a journey."
Although the comparison is not completed, the sense is clear; the kingdom of
heaven is like the situation here described. Faithful use of one's gifts will
lead to participation in the fullness of the kingdom, lazy inactivity to
exclusion from it.
8
 [15] Talents: see the note on
⇒
 Matthew 18:24.
9
 [18] Buried his master's money: see
the note on 
⇒
 Matthew 13:44.
10
 [20-23] Although the first two servants
have received and doubled large sums, their faithful trading is regarded by the
master as fidelity in small matters only, compared with the great
responsibilities now to be given to them. The latter are unspecified. Share
your master's joy: probably the joy of the banquet of the kingdom; cf
⇒
 Matthew 8:11.
11
 [26-28] Wicked, lazy servant: this
man's inactivity is not negligible but seriously culpable. As punishment, he
loses the gift he had received, that is now given to the first servant, whose
possessions are already great.
12
 [29] See the note on
⇒
 Matthew 13:12 where there is a similar
application of this maxim.
13
 [30] See the note on
⇒
 Matthew 8:11-12.
14
 [31-46] The conclusion of the
discourse, which is peculiar to Matthew, portrays the final judgment that will
accompany the parousia. Although often called a "parable," it is not
really such, for the only parabolic elements are the depiction of the Son of
Man as a shepherd and of the righteous and the wicked as sheep and goats
respectively (
⇒
 Matthew 25:32-33). The criterion of
judgment will be the deeds of mercy that have been done for the least of Jesus'
brothers (
⇒
 Matthew 25:40). A difficult and
important question is the identification of these least brothers. Are they all
people who have suffered hunger, thirst, etc. (
⇒
25:35, 
⇒
 36) or a particular group of
such sufferers? Scholars are divided in their response and arguments can be
made for either side. But leaving aside the problem of what the traditional
material that Matthew edited may have meant, it seems that a stronger case can
be made for the view that in the evangelist's sense the sufferers are
Christians, probably Christian missionaries whose sufferings were brought upon
them by their preaching of the gospel. The criterion of judgment for all the nations
is their treatment of those who have borne to the world the message of Jesus,
and this means ultimately their acceptance or rejection of Jesus himself; cf
⇒
 Matthew 10:40, "Whoever receives you,
receives me."
See the note
on 
⇒
 Matthew 16:27. 
15
 [32] All the nations: before the
end the gospel will have been preached throughout the world
(
⇒
 Matthew 24:14); thus the Gentiles will be judged
on their response to it. But the phrase all the nations includes the Jews also,
for at the judgment "the Son of Man . . . will repay everyone according to
his conduct" (
⇒
 Matthew 16:27).
16
 [37-40] The righteous will be
astonished that in caring for the needs of the sufferers they were ministering
to the Lord himself. One of these least brothers of mine: cf
⇒
 Matthew 10:42.
17
 [41] Fire prepared . . . his
angels: cf 1 Enoch 10, 13 where it is said of the evil angels and Semyaza,
their leader, "In those days they will lead them into the bottom of the
fire - and in torment - in the prison (where) they will be locked up
forever."
18
 [44-45] The accursed
(
⇒
 Matthew 25:41) will be likewise astonished that
their neglect of the sufferers was neglect of the Lord and will receive from
him a similar answer.
