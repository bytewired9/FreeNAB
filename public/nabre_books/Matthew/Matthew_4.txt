[1]
 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the
desert to be tempted by the devil. 
2
He fasted for forty days and forty nights, 
[2]
and afterwards he was hungry. 
3
The tempter approached and said to him,
"If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become loaves of
bread." 
4
[3]
 He said in reply, "It is written: 'One
does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth
of God.'" 
5
[4]
 Then the devil took him to the holy city, and
made him stand on the parapet of the temple, 
6
and said to him, "If you are the Son of
God, throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels
concerning you and 'with their hands they will support you, lest you dash your
foot against a stone.'" 
7
Jesus answered him, "Again it is written,
'You shall not put the Lord, your God, to the test.'" 
8
Then the devil took him up to a very high
mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in their magnificence, 
9
and he said to him, "All these I shall
give to you, if you will prostrate yourself and worship me." 
[5]
10
At this, Jesus said to him, "Get away,
Satan! It is written: 'The Lord, your God, shall you worship and him alone
shall you serve.'" 
11
Then the devil left him and, behold, angels
came and ministered to him. 
12
[6]
 When he heard that John had been arrested, he
withdrew to Galilee. 
13
He left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum
by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, 
14
that what had been said through Isaiah the
prophet might be fulfilled: 
15
"Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the
way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, 
16
the people who sit in darkness have seen a
great light, on those dwelling in a land overshadowed by death light has
arisen." 
17
[7]
 From that time on, Jesus began to preach and
say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." 
18
[8]
 As he was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he
saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a
net into the sea; they were fishermen. 
19
He said to them, "Come after me, and I
will make you fishers of men." 
20
[9]
 At once they left their nets and followed him.
21
He walked along from there and saw two other
brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat,
with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. He called them, 
22
and immediately they left their boat and their
father and followed him. 
23
[10]
 He went around all of Galilee, teaching in
their synagogues, 
[11]
 proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom,
and curing every disease and illness among the people. 
24
[12]
 His fame spread to all of Syria, and they
brought to him all who were sick with various diseases and racked with pain,
those who were possessed, lunatics, and paralytics, and he cured them. 
25
And great crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, 
[13]
Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan followed him. 
1
 [1-11] Jesus, proclaimed Son of God
at his baptism, is subjected to a triple temptation. Obedience to the Father is
a characteristic of true sonship, and Jesus is tempted by the devil to rebel
against God, overtly in the third case, more subtly in the first two. Each
refusal of Jesus is expressed in language taken from the Book of Deuteronomy
(
⇒
 Deut 8:3; 
⇒
 6:13,
⇒
 16). The testings of Jesus resemble those of
Israel during the wandering in the desert and later in Canaan, and the victory
of Jesus, the true Israel and the true Son, contrasts with the failure of the
ancient and disobedient "son," the old Israel. In the temptation
account Matthew is almost identical with Luke; both seem to have drawn upon the
same source. 
2
 [2] Forty days and forty nights:
the same time as that during which Moses remained on Sinai
(
⇒
 Exodus 24:18). The time reference, however,
seems primarily intended to recall the forty years during which Israel was
tempted in the desert (
⇒
 Deut 8:2).
3
 [4] Cf 
⇒
 Deut
8:3. Jesus refuses to use his power for his own benefit and accepts
whatever God wills.
4
 [5-7] The devil supports his
proposal by an appeal to the scriptures, 
⇒
 Psalm
91:11a, 
⇒
 12. Unlike Israel
(
⇒
 Deut 6:16), Jesus refuses to "test" God
by demanding from him an extraordinary show of power.
5
 [9] The worship of Satan to which
Jesus is tempted is probably intended to recall Israel's worship of false gods.
His refusal is expressed in the words of 
⇒
 Deut
6:13.
6
 [12-17] Isaiah's prophecy of the
light rising upon Zebulun and Naphtali (Isaiah
8:22-
⇒
 9:1) is fulfilled in Jesus'
residence at Capernaum. The territory of these two tribes was the first to be
devastated (733-32 B.C.) at the time of the Assyrian invasion. In order to
accommodate Jesus' move to Capernaum to the prophecy, Matthew speaks of that
town as being "in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali"
(
⇒
 Matthew 4:13), whereas it was only in the
territory of the latter, and he understands the sea of the prophecy, the
Mediterranean, as the sea of Galilee.
7
 [17] At the beginning of his
preaching Jesus takes up the words of John the Baptist
(
⇒
 Matthew 3:2) although with a different meaning; in
his ministry the kingdom of heaven has already begun to be present
(
⇒
 Matthew 12:28).
8
 [18-22] The call of the first
disciples promises them a share in Jesus' work and entails abandonment of
family and former way of life. Three of the four, Simon, James, and John, are
distinguished among the disciples by a closer relation with Jesus
(
⇒
 Matthew 17:1;
⇒
 26:37).
9
 [20] Here and in
⇒
 Matthew 4:22, as in Mark (
⇒
 Mark
1:16-20) and unlike the Lucan account (
⇒
 Luke
5:1-11), the disciples' response is motivated only by Jesus'
invitation, an element that emphasizes his mysterious power.
10
 [23-25] This summary of Jesus'
ministry concludes the narrative part of the first book of Matthew's gospel
(Matthew 3-4). The activities of his ministry are teaching, proclaiming the
gospel, and healing; cf 
⇒
 Matthew 9:35.
11
 [23] Their synagogues: Matthew
usually designates the Jewish synagogues as their synagogue(s)
(
⇒
 Matthew 9:35;
⇒
 10:17; 
⇒
 12:9;
⇒
 13:54) or, in address to Jews, your synagogues
(
⇒
 Matthew 23:34), an indication that he wrote
after the break between church and synagogue.
12
 [24] Syria: the Roman province to
which Palestine belonged.
13
 [25] The Decapolis: a federation of
Greek cities in Palestine, originally ten in number, all but one east of the
Jordan.
