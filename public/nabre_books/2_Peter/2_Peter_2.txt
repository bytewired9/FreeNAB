[1]
 There were also false prophets among the
people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will introduce
destructive heresies and even deny the Master who ransomed them, bringing swift
destruction on themselves. 
2
Many will follow their licentious ways, and
because of them the way of truth will be reviled. 
3
In their greed they will exploit you with
fabrications, but from of old their condemnation has not been idle and their
destructiondoes not sleep. 
4
[2]
[3]
 For if God did not spare
the angels when they sinned, but condemned them to the chains of Tartarus and
handed them over to be kept for judgment; 
5
[4]
 and if he did not spare the ancient world,
even though he preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, together with seven
others, when he brought a flood upon the godless world; 
6
and if he condemned the cities of Sodom and
Gomorrah (to destruction), reducing them to ashes, making them an example for
the godless (people) of what is coming; 
7
and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man
oppressed by the licentious conduct of unprincipled people 
8
(for day after day that righteous man living
among them was tormented in his righteous soul at the lawless deeds that he saw
and heard), 
9
then the Lord knows how to rescue the devout
from trial and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of
judgment, 
10
[5]
 and especially those who follow the flesh with
its depraved desire and show contempt for lordship. 
[6]
 Bold
and arrogant, they are not afraid to revile glorious beings, 
11
[7]
 whereas angels, despite their superior
strength and power, do not bring a reviling judgment against them from the
Lord. 
12
But these people, like irrational animals born
by nature for capture and destruction, revile things that they do not
understand, and in their destruction they will also be destroyed, 
13
suffering wrong 
[8]
 as payment
for wrongdoing. Thinking daytime revelry a delight, they are stains and
defilements as they revel in their deceits while carousing with you. 
14
Their eyes are full of adultery and insatiable
for sin. They seduce unstable people, and their hearts are trained in greed.
Accursed children! 
15
Abandoning the straight road, they have gone
astray, following the road of Balaam, the son of Bosor, 
[9]
who loved payment for wrongdoing, 
16
but he received a rebuke for his own crime: a
mute beast spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet's madness. 
17
These people are waterless springs and mists
driven by a gale; for them the gloom of darkness has been reserved. 
18
For, talking empty bombast, they seduce with
licentious desires of the flesh those who have barely escaped 
[10]
from people who live inerror. 
19
They promise them freedom, though they
themselves are slaves of corruption, for a person is a slave of whatever
overcomes him. 
20
For if they, having escaped the defilements of
the world through the knowledge of (our) Lord and savior Jesus Christ, again become
entangled and overcome by them, their last condition is worse than their first.
21
For it would have been better for them not to
have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the
holy commandment handed down 
[11]
 to them. 
22
[12]
 What is expressed in the true proverb has
happened to them, "The dog returns to its own vomit," and "A
bathed sow returns to wallowing in the mire." 
1
 [1-3] The pattern of false prophets
among the Old Testament people of God will recur through false teachers in the
church. Such destructive opinions of heretical sects bring loss of faith in
Christ, contempt for the way of salvation (cf 
⇒
2:21), and immorality. 
2
 [4-6] The false teachers will be
punished just as surely and as severely as were the fallen angels
(
⇒
 2 Peter 2:4; cf 
⇒
 Jude
1:6; 
⇒
 Genesis 6:1-4), the sinners of
Noah's day (
⇒
 2 Peter 2:5;
⇒
 Genesis 7:21-23), and the inhabitants of the
cities of the Plain (
⇒
 2 Peter 2:6;
⇒
 Jude 1:7; 
⇒
 Genesis
19:25). Whereas there are three examples in 
⇒
 Jude
1:5-7 (Exodus and wilderness; rebellious angels; Sodom and Gomorrah),
2 Peter omitted the first of these, has inserted a new illustration about Noah
(
⇒
 2 Peter 2:5) between Jude's second and third
examples, and listed the resulting three examples in their Old Testament order
(Genesis 6; 7; 19).
3
 [4] Chains of Tartarus: cf
⇒
 Jude 1:6; other manuscripts in 2 Peter read
"pits of Tartarus." Tartarus: a term borrowed from Greek mythology to
indicate the infernal regions.
4
 [5-10a] Although God did not spare
the sinful, he kept and saved the righteous, such as Noah (
⇒
 2
Peter 2:5) and Lot (
⇒
 2 Peter 2:7), and he
knows how to rescue the devout (
⇒
 2 Peter 2:9), who
are contrasted with the false teachers of the author's day. On Noah, cf
⇒
 Genesis 5:32-
⇒
 9:29,
especially 
⇒
 7:1. On Lot, cf Genesis 13 and 19.
5
 [10b-22] Some take
⇒
 2 Peter 2:10b, 
⇒
 11
with the preceding paragraph. Others begin the new paragraph with 
⇒
 2
Peter 2:10a, supplying from 
⇒
 2 Peter 2:9
The Lord knows how . . . to keep . . . under punishment, with reference to God
and probably specifically Christ (
⇒
 2 Peter 2:1).
The conduct of the false teachers is described and condemned in language
similar to that of 
⇒
 Jude 1:8-16. This arrogance
knows no bounds; animal-like, they are due to be caught and destroyed. They
seduce even those who have knowledge of Christ (
⇒
2:20).
6
 [10b] Glorious beings: literally,
"glories"; cf 
⇒
 Jude 1:8. While some think
that illustrious personages are meant or even political officials behind whom
(fallen) angels stand, it is more likely that the reference is to glorious
angelic beings (cf 
⇒
 Jude 1:9).
7
 [11] From the Lord: some
manuscripts read "before the Lord"; cf 
⇒
 Jude
1:9.
8
 [13] Suffering wrong: some
manuscripts read "receiving a reward." In their deceits: some
manuscripts read "in their love feasts" (
⇒
 Jude
1:12).
9
 [15] Balaam, the son of Bosor: in
⇒
 Numbers 22:5, Balaam is said to be the son of
Beor, and it is this name that turns up in a few ancient Greek manuscripts by
way of "correction" of the text. Balaam is not portrayed in such a
bad light in Numbers 22. His evil reputation and his madness (
⇒
 2
Peter 2:16), and possibly his surname Bosor, may have come from a
Jewish tradition about him in the first/second century, of which we no longer
have any knowledge.
10
 [18] Barely escaped: some
manuscripts read "really escaped."
11
 [21] Commandment handed down: cf
⇒
 2 Peter 3:2 and 
⇒
 Jude
1:3.
12
 [22] The second proverb is of
unknown origin, while the first appears in 
⇒
 Proverb 26:11.
