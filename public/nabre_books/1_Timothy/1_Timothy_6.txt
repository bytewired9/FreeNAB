[1]
 Those who are under the yoke of slavery must
regard their masters as worthy of full respect, so that the name of God and our
teaching 
[2]
 may not suffer abuse. 
2
[3]
 Those whose masters are believers must not
take advantage of them because they are brothers but must give better service
because those who will profit from their work are believers and are beloved. 
3
Whoever teaches something different and does
not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the religious
teaching 
4
is conceited, understanding nothing, and has a
morbid disposition for arguments and verbal disputes. From these come envy,
rivalry, insults, evil suspicions, 
5
and mutual friction among people with corrupted
minds, who are deprived of the truth, supposing religion to be a means of gain.
6
[4]
 Indeed, religion with contentment is a great
gain. 
7
For we brought nothing into the world, just as
we shall not be able to take anything out of it. 
8
If we have food and clothing, we shall be
content with that. 
9
Those who want to be rich are falling into
temptation and into a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires, which
plunge them into ruin and destruction. 
10
For the love of money is the root of all evils,
and some people in their desire for it have strayed from the faith and have pierced
themselves with many pains. 
11
[5]
[6]
 But you, man of God,
avoid all this. Instead, pursue righteousness, devotion, faith, love, patience,
and gentleness. 
12
Compete well for the faith. Lay hold of eternal
life, to which you were called when you made the noble confession in the
presence of many witnesses. 
13
I charge (you) before God, who gives life to
all things, and before Christ Jesus, who gave testimony under Pontius Pilate for
the noble confession, 
14
to keep the commandment without stain or
reproach until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ 
15
that the blessed and only ruler will make
manifest at the proper time, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 
16
who alone has immortality, who dwells in
unapproachable light, and whom no human being has seen or can see. To him be
honor and eternal power. Amen. 
17
[7]
 Tell the rich in the present age not to be
proud and not to rely on so uncertain a thing as wealth but rather on God, who
richly provides us with all things for our enjoyment. 
18
Tell them to do good, to be rich in good works,
to be generous, ready to share, 
19
thus accumulating as treasure a good foundation
for the future, so as to win the life that is true life. 
20
[8]
 O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to
you. Avoid profane babbling and the absurdities of so-called knowledge. 
21
By professing it, some people have deviated
from the faith. Grace be with all of you.

 [1-2] Compare the tables for
household duties, such as that of 
⇒
 Col
3:18-

 4:1. Domestic relationships derive
new meaning from the Christian faith.

 [1] Our teaching: this refers to
the teaching of the Christian community. 
3
 [2b-10] Timothy is exhorted to maintain
steadfastly the position outlined in this letter, not allowing himself to be
pressured into any other course. He must realize that false teachers can be
discerned by their pride, envy, quarrelsomeness, and greed for material gain.
⇒
 1 Tim 6:6 is rather obscure and is interpreted,
and therefore translated, variously. The suggestion seems to be that the
important gain that religion brings is spiritual, but that there is material
gain, too, up to the point of what is needed for physical sustenance (cf
⇒
 1 Tim 6:17-19).
4
 [6] Contentment: the word autarkeia
is a technical Greek philosophical term for the virtue of independence from
material goods (Aristotle, Cynics, Stoics).
5
 [11-16] Timothy's position demands
total dedication to God and faultless witness to Christ (
⇒
 1
Tim 6:11-14) operating from an awareness, through faith, of the
coming revelation in Jesus of the invisible God (
⇒
 1 Tim
6:15-16).

Moses and the prophets (

 1 Kings
12:22; 
⇒
 13:1; etc.).
7
 [17-19] Timothy is directed to
instruct the rich, advising them to make good use of their wealth by aiding the
poor.
8
 [20-21] A final solemn warning
against the heretical teachers, with what seems to be a specific reference to
gnosticism, the great rival and enemy of the church for two centuries and more
(the Greek word for "knowledge" is gnosis). If gnosticism is being
referred to here, it is probable that the warnings against
"speculations" and "myths and genealogies" (cf especially
⇒
 1 Tim 1:4; 
⇒
 Titus 3:9)
involve allusions to that same kind of heresy. Characteristic of the various
gnostic systems of speculation was an elaborate mythology of innumerable
superhuman intermediaries, on a descending scale ("genealogies"),
between God and the world. Thus would be explained the emphasis upon Christ's
being the one mediator (as in 
⇒
 1 Tim 2:5). Although
fully developed gnosticism belonged to the second and later centuries, there
are signs that incipient forms of it belonged to Paul's own period.
