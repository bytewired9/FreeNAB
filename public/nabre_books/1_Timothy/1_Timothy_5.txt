 Do not rebuke an older man, but appeal to him
as a father. Treat younger men as brothers, 
2
older women as mothers, and younger women as
sisters with complete purity. 
3
Honor widows who are truly widows. 
4
But if a widow has children or grandchildren,
let these first learn to perform their religious duty to their own family and
to make recompense to their parents, for this is pleasing to God. 
5
The real widow, who is all alone, has set her
hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day. 
6
But the one who is self-indulgent is dead while
she lives. 
7
Command this, so that they may be
irreproachable. 
8
And whoever does not provide for relatives and
especially family members has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
9
Let a widow be enrolled if she is not less than
sixty years old, married only once, 
10
with a reputation for good works, namely, that
she has raised children, practiced hospitality, washed the feet of the holy ones,
helped those in distress, involved herself in every good work. 
11
But exclude younger widows, for when their
sensuality estranges them from Christ, they want to marry 
12
and will incur condemnation for breaking their
first pledge. 
13
And furthermore, they learn to be idlers, going
about from house to house, and not only idlers but gossips and busybodies as
well, talking about things that ought not to be mentioned. 
14
So I would like younger widows to marry, have
children, and manage a home, so as to give the adversary no pretext for
maligning us. 
15
For some have already turned away to follow
Satan. 
16
If any woman believer 
[2]
 has
widowed relatives, she must assist them; the church is not to be burdened, so
that it will be able to help those who are truly widows. 
17
[3]
 Presbyters who preside well deserve double
honor, especially those who toil in preaching and teaching. 
18
For the scripture says, "You shall not
muzzle an ox when it is threshing," and, "A worker deserves his
pay." 
19
Do not accept an accusation against a presbyter
unless it is supported by two or three witnesses. 
20
Reprimand publicly those who do sin, so that
the rest also will be afraid. 
21
I charge you before God and Christ Jesus and
the elect angels to keep these rules without prejudice, doing nothing out of
favoritism. 
22
Do not lay hands too readily on anyone, and do
not share in another's sins. Keep yourself pure. 
23
Stop drinking only water, but have a little
wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent illnesses. 
24
Some people's sins are public, preceding them
to judgment; but other people are followed by their sins. 
25
Similarly, good works are also public; and even
those that are not cannot remain hidden.

 [1-16] After a few words of general
advice based on common sense (
⇒
 1 Tim 5:1-2), the
letter takes up, in its several aspects, the subject of widows. The first
responsibility for their care belongs to the family circle, not to the
Christian community as such (
⇒
 1 Tim 5:3-4, 
⇒
 16).
The widow left without the aid of relatives may benefit the community by her
prayer, and the community should consider her material sustenance its
responsibility (
⇒
 1 Tim 5:5-8). Widows who wish to work
directly for the Christian community should not be accepted unless they are
well beyond the probability of marriage, i.e., sixty years of age, married only
once, and with a reputation for good works (
⇒
 1 Tim
5:9-10). Younger widows are apt to be troublesome and should be
encouraged to remarry (
⇒
 1 Tim 5:11-15). 
2
 [16] Woman believer: some early
Latin manuscripts and Fathers have a masculine here, while most later
manuscripts and patristic quotations conflate the two readings, perhaps to
avoid unfair restriction to women.

 [17-25] The function of presbyters
is not exactly the same as that of the episkopos, "bishop"
(
⇒
 1 Tim 3:1); in fact, the relation of the two at
the time of this letter is obscure (but cf the note on 
⇒
 Titus
1:5-9). The Pastorals seem to reflect a transitional stage that
developed in many regions of the church into the monarchical episcopate of the
second and third centuries. The presbyters possess the responsibility of
preaching and teaching, for which functions they are supported by the community
(
⇒
 1 Tim 5:17-18). The realization that their
position subjects them to adverse criticism is implied in the direction to
Timothy (
⇒
 1 Tim 5:19-20) to make sure of the truth
of any accusation against them before public reproof is given. He must be as
objective as possible in weighing charges against presbyters (
⇒
 1
Tim 5:21), learning from his experience to take care in selecting
them (
⇒
 1 Tim 5:22). Some scholars take
⇒
 1 Tim 5:22 as a reference not to ordination of
presbyters but to reconciliation of public sinners. The letter now sounds an
informal note of personal concern in its advice to Timothy not to be so ascetic
that he even avoids wine (
⇒
 1 Tim 5:23). Judgment
concerning the fitness of candidates to serve as presbyters is easy with
persons of open conduct, more difficult and prolonged with those of greater
reserve (
⇒
 1 Tim 5:24-25).
