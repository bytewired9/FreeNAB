1
Children, obey your parents (in the Lord), for
this is right. 
2
"Honor your father and mother." This
is the first commandment with a promise, 
3
"that it may go well with you and that you
may have a long life on earth." 
4
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger,
but bring them up with the training and instruction of the Lord. 
5
Slaves, be obedient to your human masters with
fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ, 
6
not only when being watched, as currying favor,
but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, 
7
willingly serving the Lord and not human
beings, 
8
knowing that each will be requited from the
Lord for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free. 
9
Masters, act in the same way toward them, and
stop bullying, knowing that both they and you have a Master in heaven and that
with him there is no partiality. 
10
[1]
 Finally, draw your strength from the Lord and
from his mighty power. 
11
Put on the armor of God so that you may be able
to stand firm against the tactics of the devil. 
12
For our struggle is not with flesh and blood
but with the principalities, with the powers, with the world rulers of this
present darkness, with the evil spirits in the heavens. 
13
Therefore, put on the armor of God, that you
may be able to resist on the evil day and, having done everything, to hold your
ground. 
14
So stand fast with your loins girded in truth,
clothed with righteousness as a breastplate, 
15
and your feet shod in readiness for the gospel
of peace. 
16
In all circumstances, hold faith as a shield,
to quench all (the) flaming arrows of the evil one. 
17
And take the helmet of salvation and the sword
of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 
18
With all prayer and supplication, pray at every
opportunity in the Spirit. To that end, be watchful with all perseverance and
supplication for all the holy ones 
19
and also for me, that speech may be given me to
open my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel 
20
for which I am an ambassador in chains, so that
I may have the courage to speak as I must. 
21
[2]
 So that you also may have news of me and of
what I am doing, Tychicus, my beloved brother and trustworthy minister in the
Lord, will tell you everything. 
22
I am sending him to you for this very purpose,
so that you may know about us and that he may encourage your hearts. 
23
Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith,
from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
24
Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus
Christ in immortality. 
1
 [10-20] A general exhortation to
courage and prayer. Drawing upon the imagery and ideas of
⇒
 Isaiah 11:5; 
⇒
 59:16-17;
and 
⇒
 Wisdom 5:17-23, Paul describes the Christian
in terms of the dress and equipment of Roman soldiers. He observes, however,
that the Christian's readiness for combat is not directed against human beings
but against the spiritual powers of evil (
⇒
 Eph
6:10-17; cf 
⇒
 Eph 1:21;
⇒
 2:2; 
⇒
 3:10). Unique
importance is placed upon prayer (
⇒
 Eph 6:18-20). 
2
 [21-24] Tychicus: the bearer of the
letter; see the note on 
⇒
 Col 4:7.
⇒
 Eph 6:21-22 parallel 
⇒
 Col
4:7-8, often word for word. If Ephesians is addressed to several
Christian communities (see Introduction), it is understandable that no
greetings to individual members of these communities should have been included
in it.
