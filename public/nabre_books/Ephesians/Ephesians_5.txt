So be imitators of God, 
[1]
 as
beloved children, 
2
and live in love, as Christ loved us and handed
himself over for us as a sacrificial offering to God for a fragrant aroma. 
3
Immorality or any impurity or greed must not
even be mentioned among you, as is fitting among holy ones, 
4
no obscenity or silly or suggestive talk, which
is out of place, but instead, thanksgiving. 
5
Be sure of this, that no immoral or impure or
greedy person, that is, an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of
Christ and of God. 
6
Let no one deceive you with empty arguments,
for because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the disobedient. 
[2]
7
So do not be associated with them. 
8
For you were once darkness, but now you are
light in the Lord. Live as children of light, 
9
for light produces every kind of goodness and
righteousness and truth. 
10
Try to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. 
11
Take no part in the fruitless works of
darkness; rather expose them, 
12
for it is shameful even to mention the things
done by them in secret; 
13
but everything exposed by the light becomes
visible, 
14
for everything that becomes visible is light.
Therefore, it says: "Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ
will give you light." 
[3]
15
[4]
 Watch carefully then how you live, not as
foolish persons but as wise, 
16
making the most of the opportunity, because the
days are evil. 
17
Therefore, do not continue in ignorance, but
try to understand what is the will of the Lord. 
18
And do not get drunk on wine, in which lies debauchery,
but be filled with the Spirit, 
19
addressing one another (in) psalms and hymns
and spiritual songs, singing and playing to the Lord in your hearts, 
20
giving thanks always and for everything in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father. 
21
[5]
 Be subordinate to one another out of reverence
for Christ. 
[6]
22
Wives should be subordinate to their husbands
as to the Lord. 
23
For the husband is head of his wife just as
Christ is head of the church, he himself the savior of the body. 
24
As the church is subordinate to Christ, so
wives should be subordinate to their husbands in everything. 
25
Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ loved
the church and handed himself over for her 
26
to sanctify her, cleansing her by the bath of
water with the word, 
27
that he might present to himself the church in
splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and
without blemish. 
28
So (also) husbands should love their wives as
their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 
29
For no one hates his own flesh but rather
nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ does the church, 
30
because we are members of his body. 
31
"For this reason a man shall leave (his) father
and (his) mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one
flesh." 
32
This is a great mystery, but I speak in
reference to Christ and the church. 
33
In any case, each one of you should love his
wife as himself, and the wife should respect her husband.

(

 Eph 4:32) and in loving (as exhibited in how
Christ loved us).

 [14] An early Christian hymn,
possibly from a baptismal liturgy. For the content compare
⇒
 Eph 2:5-6; 
⇒
 3:9 and
⇒
 Isaiah 60:1.
4
 [15-16,19-20] The wording is
similar to 
⇒
 Col 4:5 and 
⇒
 Eph
3:16-17.
5
[
⇒
 5:21-
⇒
 6:9] Cf the
notes on 
⇒
 Col 3:18-
⇒
 4:1
and 
⇒
 1 Peter 2:18-
⇒
 3:7
for a similar listing of household duties where the inferior is admonished
first (wives, 
⇒
 Eph 5:22; children,
⇒
 Eph 6:1; slaves, 
⇒
 Eph
6:5), then the superior (husbands, 
⇒
 Eph
5:25; fathers, 
⇒
 Eph 6:4; masters,
⇒
 Eph 6:9). Paul varies this pattern by an emphasis
on mutuality (see 
⇒
 Eph 5:20); use of Old Testament
material about father and mother in 
⇒
 Eph 6:2; the
judgment to come for slave-owners (you have a Master in heaven,
⇒
 Eph 6:9); and above all the initial principle of
subordination to one another under Christ, thus effectively undermining
exclusive claims to domination by one party. Into the section on wives and
husbands an elaborate teaching on Christ and the church has been woven
(
⇒
 Eph 5:22-33).
6
 [21-33] The apostle exhorts married
Christians to a strong mutual love. Holding with 
⇒
 Genesis
2:24 that marriage is a divine institution (
⇒
 Eph
5:31), Paul sees Christian marriage as taking on a new meaning
symbolic of the intimate relationship of love between Christ and the church.
The wife should serve her husband in the same spirit as that of the church's
service to Christ (
⇒
 Eph 5:22,
⇒
 24), and the husband should care for his wife with
the devotion of Christ to the church (
⇒
 Eph
5:25-30). Paul gives to the Genesis passage its highest meaning in
the light of the union of Christ and the church, of which Christlike loyalty
and devotion in Christian marriage are a clear reflection
(
⇒
 Eph 5:31-33).
