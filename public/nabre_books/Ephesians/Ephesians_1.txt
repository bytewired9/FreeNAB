[1]
 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will
of God, to the holy ones who are (in Ephesus) 
[2]
 faithful in
Christ Jesus: 
2
grace to you and peace from God our Father and
the Lord Jesus Christ. 
3
[3]
 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the
heavens, 
[4]
4
as he chose us in him, before the foundation of
the world, to be holy and without blemish before him. In love 
5
he destined us for adoption to himself through
Jesus Christ, in accord with the favor of his will, 
6
for the praise of the glory of his grace that
he granted us in the beloved. 
7
In him we have redemption by his blood, the
forgiveness of transgressions, in accord with the riches of his grace 
8
that he lavished upon us. In all wisdom and
insight, 
9
he has made known to us the mystery 
[5]
of his will in accord with his favor that he set forth in him 
10
as a plan for the fullness of times, to sum up
all things in Christ, in heaven and on earth. 
11
In him we were also chosen, destined in accord
with the purpose of the one who accomplishes all things according to the
intention of his will, 
12
so that we might exist for the praise of his
glory, we who first hoped 
[6]
 in Christ. 
13
In him you also, who have heard the word of
truth, the gospel of your salvation, and have believed in him, were sealed 
[7]
with the promised holy Spirit, 
14
which is the first installment 
[8]
of our inheritance toward redemption as God's possession, to the praise of his
glory. 
15
[9]
 Therefore, I, too, hearing of your faith in
the Lord Jesus and of your love 
[10]
 for all the holy ones, 
16
do not cease giving thanks for you, remembering
you in my prayers, 
17
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation resulting in
knowledge of him. 
18
May the eyes of (your) hearts be enlightened,
that you may know what is the hope that belongs to his call, what are the
riches of glory in his inheritance among the holy ones, 
19
and what is the surpassing greatness of his
power for us who believe, in accord with the exercise of his great might, 
20
which he worked in Christ, raising him from the
dead and seating him at his right hand in the heavens, 
21
far above every principality, authority, power,
and dominion, and every name that is named not only in this age but also in the
one to come. 
22
And he put all things beneath his feet and gave
him as head over all things to the church, 
23
which is his body, 
[11]
 the
fullness of the one who fills all things in every way.

 [1-2] For the epistolary form used
at the beginning of letters, see the note on 
⇒
 Romans
1:1-7. Twenty-two of the thirty Greek words in 
⇒
 Eph
1:1-2 also occur in 
⇒
 Col 1:1-2.
2
 [1] [In Ephesus]: the phrase is
lacking in important early witnesses such as P46 (3rd cent.), and Sinaiticus
and Vaticanus (4th cent.), appearing in the latter two as a fifth-century
addition. Basil and Origen mention its absence from manuscripts. See
Introduction. Without the phrase, the Greek can be rendered, as in
⇒
 Col 1:2, "to the holy ones and faithful
brothers in Christ." 
3
 [3-14] While a Pauline letter
usually continues after the greeting with a prayer of thanksgiving, as in
⇒
 Eph 1:15-23 below, Ephesians first inserts a
blessing of God for the blessings Christians have experienced, as in
⇒
 2 Cor 1:3-4 and 
⇒
 1 Peter
1:3-12. The blessing here, akin to a Jewish berakah, is rich in
images almost certainly drawn from hymns and liturgy. Many ideas here are also
found in 
⇒
 Col 1:3-23. Certain phrases are frequently
repeated, such as in Christ (
⇒
 Eph 1:3,
⇒
 10, 
⇒
 12) or in him
(
⇒
 Eph 1:4, 7,
9, 
⇒
 11,
⇒
 13) or in the Beloved (
⇒
 Eph
1:6) and (for) the praise of (his) glory (
⇒
 Eph
1:6, 
⇒
 12,
⇒
 14). Some terms like chose (
⇒
 Eph
1:4) and destined (
⇒
 Eph 1:5) reflect Old
Testament theology (
⇒
 Deut 7:7;
⇒
 9:4-6; 
⇒
 23:5) or
Pauline themes (redemption, 
⇒
 Eph 1:7,
⇒
 14; grace, 
⇒
 Eph 1:6,
7) or specific emphases in Col (forgiveness,
⇒
 Col 1:14). A triadic structure is discernible in
⇒
 Eph 1:3-14: God the Father (
⇒
 Eph
1:3-6, 8, 
⇒
 11),
Christ (
⇒
 Eph 1:3, 5,
⇒
 7-10, 
⇒
 12), and the
Spirit (
⇒
 Eph 1:13-14). The spiritual blessings Christians
have received through Christ (
⇒
 Eph 1:3) are
gratefully enumerated: the call to holiness (
⇒
 Eph
1:4; cf 
⇒
 Col 1:22); the gift of divine
adoption establishing a unique spiritual relationship with God the Father
through Christ (
⇒
 Eph 1:5; cf 
⇒
 Gal
4:5); liberation from sin through Christ's sacrificial death
(
⇒
 Eph 1:7); revelation of God's plan of salvation in
Christ (
⇒
 Eph 1:9; cf 
⇒
 Eph
3:3-4; 
⇒
 Romans 16:25); the gift of
election and faith in Christ bestowed upon Jewish Christians (see the note on
⇒
 Eph 1:12, we who first hoped in Christ); and
finally, the same gift granted to Gentiles (
⇒
 Eph
1:13, you also). In the Christ-centered faith and existence of the
Christian communities the apostle sees the predetermined plan of God to bring
all creation under the final rule of Christ (
⇒
 Eph
1:4-5, 
⇒
 9-10) being made known
(
⇒
 Eph 1:9) and carried through, to God's glory
(
⇒
 Eph 1:6, 
⇒
 12,
⇒
 14).
4
 [3] In the heavens: literally,
"in the heavenlies" or "in the heavenly places," a term in
Eph for the divine realm.
5
 [9] Mystery: as in
⇒
 Romans 16:25; 
⇒
 Col
1:26, 
⇒
 27 and elsewhere, a secret of God
now revealed in the plan to save and sum up all things in Christ
(
⇒
 Eph 1:10); cf 
⇒
 Eph 3:3-6.
6
 [12] We who first hoped: probably
Jewish Christians (contrast 
⇒
 Eph 1:13, you, the
Gentiles); possibly the people of Israel, "we who already enjoyed the hope
of Christ," or perhaps present hope in contrast to future redemption (cf
⇒
 Eph 1:14).
7
 [13] Sealed: by God, in baptism; cf
⇒
 Eph 4:30; 
⇒
 2 Cor
1:22.
8
 [14] First installment: down
payment by God on full salvation, as at 
⇒
 2 Cor
1:22.
9
 [15-23] See the note on
⇒
 Romans 1:8 for the thanksgiving form in a letter.
Much of the content parallels thoughts in 
⇒
 Col 1:3-20.
The prayer moves from God and Christ (
⇒
 Eph 1:17,
⇒
 20-21) to the Ephesians (
⇒
 Eph
1:17-19) and the church (
⇒
 Eph 1:22-23).
Paul asks that the blessing imparted by God the Father (
⇒
 Eph
1:3) to the Ephesians will be strengthened in them through the
message of the gospel (
⇒
 Eph 1:13,
⇒
 17-19). Those blessings are seen in the context of
God's might in establishing the sovereignty of Christ over all other creatures
(
⇒
 Eph 1:19-21) and in appointing him head of the
church (
⇒
 Eph 1:22-23). For the allusion to angelic
spirits in 
⇒
 Eph 1:21, see 
⇒
 Romans
8:38 and 
⇒
 Col 1:16. Here, as in
⇒
 1 Cor 15:24-25 and 
⇒
 Col
2:15, every such principality and power is made subject to Christ.
10
 [15] Your faith . . . your love:
some manuscripts omit the latter phrase, but cf 
⇒
 Col
1:4.
11
 [23] His body: the church
(
⇒
 Eph 1:22); cf the note on 
⇒
 Col
1:18. Only in Eph and Col is Christ the head of the body, in contrast
to the view in 1 Cor 12 and 
⇒
 Romans 12:4-8 where
Christ is equated with the entire body or community. Fullness: see the note on
⇒
 Col 1:19. Some take the one who fills as God,
others as Christ (cf 
⇒
 Eph 4:10). If in Christ
"dwells the fullness of the deity bodily" (
⇒
 Col
2:9), then, as God "fills" Christ, Christ in turn fills the
church and the believer (
⇒
 Eph 3:19;
⇒
 5:18). But the difficult phrases here may also
allow the church to be viewed as the "complement" of Christ who is
"being filled" as God's plan for the universe is carried out through
the church (cf 
⇒
 Eph 3:9-10).
