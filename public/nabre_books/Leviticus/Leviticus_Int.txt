Introduction
The
name "Leviticus" was bestowed on the third book of the Pentateuch by
the ancient Greek translators because a good part of this book consists of
sacrificial and other ritual laws prescribed for the priests of the tribe of
Levi.
Continuing the legislation given by God to Moses at Mount Sinai, Leviticus is
almost entirely legislative in character; the rare narrative portions are
subordinate to the main legislative theme. Generally speaking, the laws
contained in this book serve to teach the Israelites that they should always
keep themselves in a state of legal purity, or external sanctity, as a sign of
their intimate union with the Lord. Accordingly, the central idea of Leviticus
is contained in its oft-repeated injunction: "You shall be holy, because I,
the LORD, am holy."
The main divisions of Leviticus are:
I.          
Ritual
of Sacrifices (Lev 1-7) 
II.          
Ceremony
of Ordination (Lev 8-10) 
III.          
Laws
regarding Legal Purity (Lev 11-16) 
IV.          
Code
of Legal Holiness (Lev 17-26) 
V.          
Redemption
of Offerings (Lev 27)
