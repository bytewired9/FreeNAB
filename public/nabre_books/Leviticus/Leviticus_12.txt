The LORD said to Moses, 
2
[1]
 "Tell the Israelites: When a woman has
conceived and gives birth to a boy, she shall be unclean for seven days, with
the same uncleanness as at her menstrual period. 
3
On the eighth day, the flesh of the boy's
foreskin shall be circumcised, 
4
and then she shall spend thirty-three days more
in becoming purified of her blood; she shall not touch anything sacred nor
enter the sanctuary till the days of her purification are fulfilled. 
5
If she gives birth to a girl, for fourteen days
she shall be as unclean as at her menstruation, after which she shall spend
sixty-six days in becoming purified of her blood. 
6
"When the days of her purification for a
son or for a daughter are fulfilled, she shall bring to the priest at the
entrance of the meeting tent a yearling lamb for a holocaust and a pigeon or a
turtledove for a sin offering. 
7
The priest shall offer them up before the LORD
to make atonement for her, and thus she will be clean again after her flow of
blood. Such is the law for the woman who gives birth to a boy or a girl child. 
8
[2]
 If, however, she cannot afford a lamb, she may
take two turtledoves or two pigeons, the one for a holocaust and the other for
a sin offering. The priest shall make atonement for her, and thus she will
again be clean." 
1
 [2-3] The uncleanness of the woman
was more serious during the first period, the seven days after the birth of a
boy or the fourteen days after the birth of a girl; only during this period
would the rules given in 
⇒
 Lev 15:19-24 apply.
2
 [8] Forty days after the birth of
Jesus, his Virgin Mother made this offering of the poor
(
⇒
 Luke 2:22, 
⇒
 24);
since the holocaust was offered in thanksgiving for the birth of the child,
this was most fittingly offered by Mary. However, because of her miraculous
delivery, she was not really obliged to make the sin offering of purification.
