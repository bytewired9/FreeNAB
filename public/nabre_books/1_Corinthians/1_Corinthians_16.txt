 Now in regard to the
collection for the holy ones, you also should do as I ordered the churches of
Galatia. 
2
On the first day of the week each of you should
set aside and save whatever one can afford, so that collections will not be
going on when I come. 
3
And when I arrive, I shall send those whom you
have approved with letters of recommendation to take your gracious gift to
Jerusalem. 
4
If it seems fitting that I should go also, 
[3]
they will go with me. 
5
[4]
 I shall come to you after I pass through
Macedonia (for I am going to pass through Macedonia), 
6
and perhaps I shall stay or even spend the
winter with you, so that you may send me on my way wherever I may go. 
7
For I do not wish to see you now just in
passing, but I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. 
8
[5]
 I shall stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, 
9
because a door has opened for me wide and
productive for work, but there are many opponents. 
10
If Timothy comes, see that he is without fear
in your company, for he is doing the work of the Lord just as I am. 
11
Therefore no one should disdain him. Rather,
send him on his way in peace that he may come to me, for I am expecting him
with the brothers. 
12
Now in regard to our brother Apollos, I urged
him strongly to go to you with the brothers, but it was not at all his will
that he go now. He will go when he has an opportunity. 
13
Be on your guard, stand firm in the faith, be
courageous, be strong. 
14
Your every act should be done with love. 
15
I urge you, brothers - you know that the
household of Stephanas is the firstfruits of Achaia and that they have devoted
themselves to the service of the holy ones - 
16
be subordinate to such people and to everyone
who works and toils with them. 
17
I rejoice in the arrival of Stephanas,
Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because they made up for your absence, 
18
for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours.
So give recognition to such people. 
19
[6]
 The churches of Asia send you greetings.
Aquila and Prisca together with the church at their house send you many
greetings in the Lord. 
20
All the brothers greet you. Greet one another
with a holy kiss. 
21
I, Paul, write you this greeting in my own
hand. 
22
If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be
accursed. 
[7]
 Marana tha. 
23
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. 
24
My love to all of you in Christ Jesus.

 [1-4] This paragraph contains our
earliest evidence for a project that became a major undertaking of Paul's
ministry. The collection for the church at Jerusalem was a symbol in his mind
for the unity of Jewish and Gentile Christianity. Cf 
⇒
 Gal
2:10; 
⇒
 Romans 15:25-29; 2 Cor 8-9 and
the notes to this last passage.
2
 [1] In regard to the collection: it
has already begun in Galatia and Macedonia (cf 2 Cor 8), and presumably he has
already instructed the Corinthians about its purpose. 
3
 [4] That I should go also:
presumably Paul delivered the collection on his final visit to Jerusalem; cf
⇒
 Romans 15:25-32; 
⇒
 Acts
24:14.
4
 [5-12] The travel plans outlined
here may not have materialized precisely as Paul intended; cf
⇒
 2 Cor 1:8-
⇒
 2:13;
⇒
 7:4-16.
5
 [8] In Ephesus until Pentecost:
this tells us the place from which he wrote the letter and suggests he may have
composed it about Easter time (cf 
⇒
 1 Cor 5:7-8).
6
 [19-24] These paragraphs conform to
the normal epistolary conclusion, but their language is overlaid with
liturgical coloration as well. The greetings of the Asian churches are probably
to be read, along with the letter, in the liturgy at Corinth, and the union of
the church is to be expressed by a holy kiss (
⇒
 1 Cor
16:19-20). Paul adds to this his own greeting (
⇒
 1
Cor 16:21) and blessings (
⇒
 1 Cor
16:23-24).
7
 [22] Accursed: literally,
"anathema." This expression (cf 
⇒
 1 Cor
12:3) is a formula for exclusion from the community; it may imply
here a call to self-examination before celebration of the Eucharist, in
preparation for the Lord's coming and judgment (cf 
⇒
 1 Cor
11:17-34). Marana tha: an Aramaic expression, probably used in the
early Christian liturgy. As understood here ("O Lord, come!"), it is
a prayer for the early return of Christ. If the Aramaic words are divided
differently (Maran atha, "Our Lord has come"), it becomes a credal
declaration. The former interpretation is supported by what appears to be a
Greek equivalent of this acclamation in 
⇒
 Rev 22:20
"Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!"
