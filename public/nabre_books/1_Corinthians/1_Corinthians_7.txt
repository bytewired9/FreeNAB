 Now
in regard to the matters about which you wrote: "It is a good thing for a
man not to touch a woman," 
2
but because of cases of immorality every man
should have his own wife, and every woman her own husband. 
3
The husband should fulfill his duty toward his
wife, and likewise the wife toward her husband. 
4
A wife does not have authority over her own
body, but rather her husband, and similarly a husband does not have authority
over his own body, but rather his wife. 
5
Do not deprive each other, except perhaps by
mutual consent for a time, to be free for prayer, but then return to one
another, so that Satan may not tempt you through your lack of self-control. 
6
This I say by way of concession, 
[4]
however, not as a command. 
7
Indeed, I wish everyone to be as I am, but each
has a particular gift from God, 
[5]
 one of one kind and one of
another. 
8
[6]
 Now to the unmarried and to widows, I say: it
is a good thing for them to remain as they are, as I do, 
9
but if they cannot exercise self-control they
should marry, for it is better to marry than to be on fire. 
10
To the married, however, I give this
instruction (not I, but the Lord): 
[7]
 a wife should not
separate from her husband 
11
 - and
if she does separate she must either remain single or become reconciled to her
husband - and a husband should not divorce his wife. 
12
To the rest 
[8]
 I say (not the
Lord): if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she is willing to go
on living with him, he should not divorce her; 
13
and if any woman has a husband who is an
unbeliever, and he is willing to go on living with her, she should not divorce
her husband. 
14
For the unbelieving husband is made holy
through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy through the brother.
Otherwise your children would be unclean, whereas in fact they are holy. 
15
If the unbeliever separates, 
[9]
however, let him separate. The brother or sister is not bound in such cases;
God has called you to peace. 
16
For how do you know, wife, whether you will
save your husband; or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your
wife? 
17
[10]
 Only, everyone should live as the Lord has
assigned, just as God called each one. I give this order in all the churches. 
18
Was someone called after he had been
circumcised? He should not try to undo his circumcision. Was an uncircumcised
person called? He should not be circumcised. 
19
Circumcision means nothing, and uncircumcision
means nothing; what matters is keeping God's commandments. 
20
Everyone should remain in the state in which he
was called. 
21
Were you a slave when you were called? Do not
be concerned but, even if you can gain your freedom, make the most of it. 
22
For the slave called in the Lord is a freed
person in the Lord, just as the free person who has been called is a slave of
Christ. 
23
You have been purchased at a price. Do not
become slaves to human beings. 
24
Brothers, everyone should continue before God
in the state in which he was called. 
25
Now in regard to virgins, I have no commandment
from the Lord, 
[11]
 but I give my opinion as one who by the
Lord's mercy is trustworthy. 
26
So this is what I think best because of the
present distress: that it is a good thing for a person to remain as he is. 
27
Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek a
separation. Are you free of a wife? Then do not look for a wife. 
28
If you marry, however, you do not sin, nor does
an unmarried woman sin if she marries; but such people will experience
affliction in their earthly life, and I would like to spare you that. 
29
[12]
 I tell you, brothers, the time is running out.
From now on, let those having wives act as not having them, 
30
those weeping as not weeping, those rejoicing
as not rejoicing, those buying as not owning, 
31
those using the world as not using it fully.
For the world in its present form is passing away. 
32
I should like you to be free of anxieties. An
unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how he may please the
Lord. 
33
But a married man is anxious about the things
of the world, how he may please his wife, 
34
and he is divided. An unmarried woman or a
virgin is anxious about the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy in both
body and spirit. A married woman, on the other hand, is anxious about the
things of the world, how she may please her husband. 
35
I am telling you this for your own benefit, not
to impose a restraint upon you, but for the sake of propriety and adherence to
the Lord without distraction. 
36
[13]
[14]
 If anyone thinks he is
behaving improperly toward his virgin, and if a critical moment has come and so
it has to be, let him do as he wishes. He is committing no sin; let them get
married. 
37
The one who stands firm in his resolve,
however, who is not under compulsion but has power over his own will, and has
made up his mind to keep his virgin, will be doing well. 
38
So then, the one who marries his virgin does
well; the one who does not marry her will do better. 
39
[15]
 A wife is bound to her husband as long as he
lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whomever she
wishes, provided that it be in the Lord. 
40
She is more blessed, though, in my opinion, if
she remains as she is, and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.

 [1-40] Paul now begins to answer
questions addressed to him by the Corinthians (
⇒
 1 Cor
7:1-
⇒
 11:1). The first of these concerns
marriage. This chapter contains advice both to the married (1-16) and to the
unmarried (
⇒
 1 Cor 7:25-38) or widowed
(
⇒
 1 Cor 7:39-40); these two parts are separated by
⇒
 1 Cor 7:17-24, which enunciate a principle
applicable to both.
2
 [1-16] It seems that some
Christians in Corinth were advocating asceticism in sexual matters. The pattern
it is a good thing . . . , but occurs twice (
⇒
 1 Cor
7:1-2, 
⇒
 8-9; cf 
⇒
 1 Cor
7:26), suggesting that in this matter as in others the Corinthians
have seized upon a genuine value but are exaggerating or distorting it in some
way. Once again Paul calls them to a more correct perspective and a better
sense of their own limitations. The phrase it is a good thing
(
⇒
 1 Cor 7:1) may have been the slogan of the
ascetic party at Corinth.
3
 [1-7] References to Paul's own
behavior (
⇒
 1 Cor 7:7-8) suggest that his celibate
way of life and his preaching to the unmarried (cf 
⇒
 1 Cor
7:25-35) have given some the impression that asceticism within marriage,
i.e., suspension of normal sexual relations, would be a laudable ideal. Paul
points to their experience of widespread immorality to caution them against
overestimating their own strength (
⇒
 1 Cor 7:2); as
individuals they may not have the particular gift that makes such asceticism
feasible (
⇒
 1 Cor 7:7) and hence are to abide by the
principle to be explained in 
⇒
 1 Cor 7:17-24. 
4
 [6] By way of concession: this
refers most likely to the concession mentioned in 
⇒
 1 Cor
7:5a: temporary interruption of relations for a legitimate purpose.
5
 [7] A particular gift from God: use
of the term charisma suggests that marriage and celibacy may be viewed in the
light of Paul's theology of spiritual gifts (
⇒
 1 Cor
7:12-14).
6
 [8] Paul was obviously unmarried
when he wrote this verse. Some interpreters believe that he had previously been
married and widowed; there is no clear evidence either for or against this
view, which was expressed already at the end of the second century by Clement
of Alexandria.
7
 [10-11] (Not I, but the Lord): Paul
reminds the married of Jesus' principle of nonseparation
(
⇒
 Mark 10:9). This is one of his rare specific
references to the teaching of Jesus.
8
 [12-14] To the rest: marriages in
which only one partner is a baptized Christian. Jesus' prohibition against
divorce is not addressed to them, but Paul extends the principle of
nonseparation to such unions, provided they are marked by peacefulness and
shared sanctification.
9
 [15-16] If the unbeliever
separates: the basis of the "Pauline privilege" in Catholic marriage
legislation.
10
 [17-24] On the ground that distinct
human conditions are less significant than the whole new existence opened up by
God's call, Paul urges them to be less concerned with changing their states of life
than with answering God's call where it finds them. The principle applies both
to the married state (
⇒
 1 Cor 7:1-16) and to the
unmarried (
⇒
 1 Cor 7:25-38).
11
 [25-28] Paul is careful to explain
that the principle of 
⇒
 1 Cor 7:17 does not bind
under sin but that present earthly conditions make it advantageous for the
unmarried to remain as they are (
⇒
 1 Cor 7:28).
These remarks must be complemented by the statement about "particular
gifts" from 
⇒
 1 Cor 7:7.
12
 [29-31] The world . . . is passing
away: Paul advises Christians to go about the ordinary activities of life in a
manner different from those who are totally immersed in them and unaware of
their transitoriness.
13
 [36-38] The passage is difficult to
interpret, because it is unclear whether Paul is thinking of a father and his
unmarried daughter (or slave), or of a couple engaged in a betrothal or
spiritual marriage. The general principles already enunciated apply: there is
no question of sin, even if they should marry, but staying as they are is
"better" (for the reasons mentioned in 
⇒
 1 Cor
7:28-35). Once again the charisma of 
⇒
 1 Cor
7:7 which applies also to the unmarried (
⇒
 1 Cor
7:8-9), is to be presupposed.
14
 [36] A critical moment has come:
either because the woman will soon be beyond marriageable age, or because their
passions are becoming uncontrollable (cf 
⇒
 1 Cor
7:9).
15
 [39-40] Application of the
principles to the case of widows. If they do choose to remarry, they ought to
prefer Christian husbands.
