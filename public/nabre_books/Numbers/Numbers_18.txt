 The LORD said to Aaron, "You and your
sons as well as the other members of your ancestral house shall be responsible for
the sanctuary; but the responsibility of the priesthood shall rest on you and
your sons alone. 
2
[2]
 Bring with you also your other kinsmen of the
tribe of Levi, your ancestral tribe, as your associates and assistants, while
you and your sons are in front of the tent of the commandments. 
3
They shall look after your persons and the
whole tent; however, they shall not come near the sacred vessels or the altar,
lest both they and you die. 
4
[3]
 As your associates they shall have charge of
all the work connected with the meeting tent. But no layman shall come near
you. 
5
You shall have charge of the sanctuary and of
the altar, that wrath may not fall again upon the Israelites. 
6
"Remember, it is I who have taken your
kinsmen, the Levites, from the body of the Israelites; they are a gift to you,
dedicated to the LORD for the service of the meeting tent. 
7
[4]
 But only you and your sons are to have charge
of performing the priestly functions in whatever concerns the altar and the
room within the veil. I give you the priesthood as a gift. Any layman who draws
near shall be put to death." 
8
[5]
 The LORD said to Aaron, "I myself have
given you charge of the contributions made to me in the various sacred
offerings of the Israelites; by perpetual ordinance I have assigned them to you
and to your sons as your priestly share. 
9
You shall have the right to share in the
oblations that are most sacred, in whatever they offer me as cereal offerings
or sin offerings or guilt offerings; these shares shall accrue to you and to
your sons. 
10
In eating them you shall treat them as most
sacred; every male among you may partake of them. As sacred, they belong to
you. 
11
[6]
 "You shall also have what is removed from
the gift in every wave offering of the Israelites; by perpetual ordinance I
have assigned it to you and to your sons and daughters. All in your family who
are clean may partake of it. 
12
I have also assigned to you all the best of the
new oil and of the new wine and grain that they give to the LORD as their first
fruits; 
13
and likewise, of whatever grows on their land,
the first products that they bring in to the LORD shall be yours; all of your
family who are clean may partake of them. 
14
[7]
 Whatever is doomed in Israel shall be yours. 
15
Every living thing that opens the womb, whether
of man or of beast, such as are to be offered to the LORD, shall be yours; but
you must let the first-born of man, as well as of unclean animals, be redeemed.
16
The ransom for a boy is to be paid when he is a
month old; it is fixed at five silver shekels according to the sanctuary
standard, twenty gerahs to the shekel. 
17
But the first-born of cattle, sheep or goats
shall not be redeemed; they are sacred. Their blood you must splash on the
altar and their fat you must burn as a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD. 
18
Their meat, however, shall be yours, just as
the breast and the right leg of the wave offering belong to you. 
19
[8]
 By perpetual ordinance I have assigned to you
and to your sons and daughters all the contributions from the sacred gifts
which the Israelites make to the LORD; this is an inviolable covenant to last
forever before the LORD, for you and for your descendants." 
20
[9]
 Then the LORD said to Aaron, "You shall
not have any heritage in the land of the Israelites nor hold any portion among
them; I will be your portion and your heritage among them. 
21
"To the Levites, however, I hereby assign
all tithes in Israel as their heritage in recompense for the service they
perform in the meeting tent. 
22
The Israelites may no longer approach the
meeting tent; else they will incur guilt deserving death. 
23
Only the Levites are to perform the service of
the meeting tent, and they alone shall be held responsible; this is a perpetual
ordinance for all your generations. The Levites, therefore, shall not have any heritage
among the Israelites, 
24
for I have assigned to them as their heritage
the tithes which the Israelites give as a contribution to the LORD. That is why
I have ordered that they are not to have any heritage among the
Israelites." 
25
The LORD said to Moses, 
26
"Give the Levites these instructions: When
you receive from the Israelites the tithes I have assigned you from them as
your heritage, you are to make a contribution from them to the LORD, a tithe of
the tithes; 
27
and your contribution will be credited to you
as if it were grain from the threshing floor or new wine from the press. 
28
Thus you too shall make a contribution from all
the tithes you receive from the Israelites, handing over to Aaron the priest
the part to be contributed to the LORD. 
29
From all the gifts that you receive, and from
the best parts, you are to consecrate to the LORD your own full contribution. 
30
"Tell them also: Once you have made your
contribution from the best part, the rest of the tithes will be credited to you
Levites as if it were produce of the threshing floor or of the winepress. 
31
Your families, as well as you, may eat them
anywhere, since they are your recompense for service at the meeting tent. 
32
You will incur no guilt so long as you make a
contribution of the best part. Do not profane the sacred gifts of the
Israelites and so bring death on yourselves."

 [1-3] This law, which kept unqualified
persons from contact with sacred things, is the answer to the Israelites' cry
in 
⇒
 Numbers 17:13(28). It is followed by other
laws concerning priests and Levites.
2
 [2] Associates: in Hebrew this word
alludes to the popular etymology of the name "Levi." Cf 
⇒
 Genesis
29:34.
3
 [4] Layman: here, "one who is
not a Levite"; in 
⇒
 Numbers 18:7, "one who
is not a priest."
4
 [7] Veil: the outer veil, or
"curtain," is probably meant.
5
 [8-10] Two classes of offerings are
here distinguished: the most sacred offering, which only the male members of
the priestly families could eat, and the other offerings, which even the women
of the priestly families could eat (
⇒
18:11-19).
6
 [11] Wave offering: this included
the breast and right leg (
⇒
 Numbers 18:18), the
shoulder of the peace offering (
⇒
 Lev 7:30-34), and
portions of the nazirite sacrifice (
⇒
6:19-20).
7
 [14] Doomed: in Hebrew, herem,
which means here "set aside from profane use and made sacred to the
Lord." Cf 
⇒
 Lev 27:21,
⇒
 28,
8
 [19] An inviolable covenant:
literally, "a convenant of salt." Cf 
⇒
 2 Chron 13:5. The reference may perhaps be to the
preservative power of salt (cf 
⇒
 Matthew 5:13); but
more likely the phrase refers to the custom of partaking of the same salt in
common to render a contract unbreakable. See note on 
⇒
 Lev
2:13.
9
 [20] The priests and Levites were
forbidden to own hereditary land such as the other Israelites possessed;
therefore in the allotment of the land they were not to receive any portion of
it. Certain cities, however, were assigned to them for their residence; cf
⇒
 35:1-8.
