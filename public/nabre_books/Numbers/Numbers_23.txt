1
Then Balaam said to Balak, "Build me seven
altars, and prepare seven bullocks and seven rams for me here." 
2
So he did as Balaam had ordered, offering a
bullock and a ram on each altar. And Balak said to him, "I have erected
the seven altars, and have offered a bullock and a ram on each." 
3
Balaam then said to him, "Stand here by
your holocaust while I go over there. Perhaps the LORD will meet me, and then I
will tell you whatever he lets me see." He went out on the barren height, 
4
and God met him. 
5
When he had put an utterance in Balaam's mouth,
the LORD said to him, "Go back to Balak, and speak accordingly." 
6
So he went back to Balak, who was still
standing by his holocaust together with all the princes of Moab. 
7
[1]
 Then Balaam gave voice to his oracle: From
Aram has Balak brought me here, Moab's king, from the Eastern Mountains:
"Come and lay a curse for me on Jacob, come and denounce Israel." 
8
How can I curse whom God has not cursed? How
denounce whom the LORD has not denounced? 
9
[2]
 For from the top of the crags I see him, from
the heights I behold him. Here is a people that lives apart and does not reckon
itself among the nations. 
10
[3]
 Who has ever counted the dust of Jacob, or
numbered Israel's wind-borne particles? May I die the death of the just, may my
descendants be as many as theirs! 
11
"What have you done to me?" cried
Balak to Balaam. "It was to curse my foes that I brought you here;
instead, you have even blessed them." 
12
Balaam replied, "Is it not what the LORD
puts in my mouth that I must repeat with care?" 
13
[4]
 Then Balak said to him, "Please come with
me to another place from which you can see only some and not all of them, and
from there curse them for me." 
14
So he brought him to the lookout field on the
top of Pisgah, where he built seven altars and offered a bullock and a ram on
each of them. 
15
Balaam then said to Balak, "Stand here by
your holocaust, while I seek a meeting over there." 
16
Then the LORD met Balaam, and having put an
utterance in his mouth, he said to him, "Go back to Balak, and speak
accordingly." 
17
So he went back to Balak, who was still
standing by his holocaust together with the princes of Moab. When Balak asked
him, "What did the LORD say?" 
18
Balaam gave voice to his oracle: Be aroused, O
Balak, and hearken; give ear to my testimony, O son of Zippor! 
19
God is not man that he should speak falsely,
nor human, that he should change his mind. Is he one to speak and not act, to
decree and not fulfill? 
20
It is a blessing I have been given to
pronounce; a blessing which I cannot restrain. 
21
[5]
 Misfortune is not observed in Jacob, nor
misery seen in Israel. The LORD, his God, is with him; with him is the triumph
of his King. 
22
[6]
 It is God who brought him out of Egypt, a wild
bull of towering might. 
23
No, there is no sorcery against Jacob, nor omen
against Israel. It shall yet be said of Jacob, and of Israel, "Behold what
God has wrought!" 
24
Here is a people that springs up like a lioness,
and stalks forth like a lion; It rests not till it has devoured its prey and
has drunk the blood of the slain. 
25
"Even though you cannot curse them,"
said Balak to Balaam, "at least do not bless them." 
26
But Balaam answered Balak, "Did I not warn
you that I must do all that the LORD tells me?" 
27
Then Balak said to Balaam, "Come, let me
bring you to another place; perhaps God will approve of your cursing them for
me from there." 
28
So he took Balaam to the top of Peor, that
overlooks Jeshimon. 
29
Balaam then said to him, "Here build me
seven altars; and here prepare for me seven bullocks and seven rams." 
30
And Balak did as Balaam had ordered, offering a
bullock and a ram on each altar. 
1
 [7] Aram: the ancient name of the
region later known as Syria. The Eastern Mountains: the low ranges in the
Syrian desert near the Euphrates and Balaam's town of Pethor; cf
â‡’
 Numbers 22:5.
2
 [9] A people that lives apart: Israel,
as the chosen people of God, occupied a unique place among the nations, from
which they kept themselves aloof.
3
 [10] The dust of Jacob . . .
Israel's wind-borne particles: the Israelites will be as numerous as dust in a
desert sandstorm. May I . . . as many as theirs: a formula by which Balaam
swears he is speaking the truth; he sees the reward of virtue in having
numerous descendants.
4
 [13] To another place: Balak
thought that if Balaam would view Israel from a different site, he could
forecast a different kind of omen.
5
 [21] Misfortune . . . misery:
Balaam admits that he is unable to predict any evils for Israel.
6
 [22] A wild bull of towering might:
the reference is to Israel, rather than to God.
