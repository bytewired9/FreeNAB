[1]
 The whole Israelite community arrived in the
desert of Zin in the first month, and the people settled at Kadesh. It was here
that Miriam died, and here that she was buried. 
2
As the community had no water, they held a
council against Moses and Aaron. 
3
The people contended with Moses, exclaiming,
"Would that we too had perished with our kinsmen in the LORD'S presence! 
4
Why have you brought the LORD'S community into
this desert where we and our livestock are dying? 
5
Why did you lead us out of Egypt, only to bring
us to this wretched place which has neither grain nor figs nor vines nor
pomegranates? Here there is not even water to drink!" 
6
But Moses and Aaron went away from the assembly
to the entrance of the meeting tent, where they fell prostrate. Then the glory
of the LORD appeared to them, 
7
and the LORD said to Moses, 
8
"Take the staff and assemble the
community, you and your brother Aaron, and in their presence order the rock to
yield its waters. From the rock you shall bring forth water for the community
and their livestock to drink." 
9
So Moses took the staff from its place before
the LORD, as he was ordered. 
10
He and Aaron assembled the community in front
of the rock, where he said to them, "Listen to me, you rebels! Are we to
bring water for you out of this rock?" 
11
[2]
 Then, raising his hand, Moses struck the rock
twice with his staff, and water gushed out in abundance for the community and
their livestock to drink. 
12
[3]
 But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
"Because you were not faithful to me in showing forth my sanctity before
the Israelites, you shall not lead this community into the land I will give
them." 
13
These are the waters of Meribah, where the
Israelites contended against the LORD, and where he revealed his sanctity among
them. 
14
[4]
 From Kadesh Moses sent men to the king of Edom
with the message: "Your brother Israel has this to say: You know of all
the hardships that have befallen us, 
15
how our fathers went down to Egypt, where we
stayed a long time, how the Egyptians maltreated us and our fathers, 
16
and how, when we cried to the LORD, he heard
our cry and sent an angel who led us out of Egypt. Now here we are at the town
of Kadesh at the edge of your territory. 
17
[5]
 Kindly let us pass through your country. We
will not cross any fields or vineyards, nor drink any well water, but we will
go straight along the royal road without turning to the right or to the left,
until we have passed through your territory." 
18
But Edom answered him, "You shall not pass
through here; if you do, I will advance against you with the sword." 
19
The Israelites insisted, "We want only to
go up along the highway. If we or our livestock drink any of your water, we
will pay for it. Surely there is no harm in merely letting us march
through." 
20
But Edom still said, "No, you shall not
pass through," and advanced against them with a large and heavily armed
force. 
21
Therefore, since Edom refused to let them pass
through their territory, Israel detoured around them. 
22
[6]
 Setting out from Kadesh, the whole Israelite community
came to Mount Hor. 
23
There at Mount Hor, on the border of the land
of Edom, the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
24
"Aaron is about to be taken to his people;
he shall not enter the land I am giving to the Israelites, because you both
rebelled against my commandment at the waters of Meribah. 
25
Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them
up on Mount Hor. 
26
Then strip Aaron of his garments and put them
on his son Eleazar; for there Aaron shall be taken in death." 
27
Moses did as the LORD commanded. When they had
climbed Mount Hor in view of the whole community, 
28
Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put
them on his son Eleazar. Then Aaron died there on top of the mountain. When
Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain, 
29
all the community understood that Aaron had
passed away; and for thirty days the whole house of Israel mourned him. 
1
 [1] The first month: we would
expect the mention also of the day and of the year (after the exodus) when this
took place; cf similar dates in 
⇒
 Numbers 1:1;
⇒
 10:11; 
⇒
 33:38;
⇒
 Deut 1:3. Here the full date seems to have been
lost. Probably the Israelites arrived in Kadesh in the third year after the
exodus. Cf
⇒
 Deut 1:46. The desert of Zin: a barren region with a few
good oases, southwest of the Dead Sea. See note on 
⇒
13:21.
2
 [11] Twice: perhaps because he had
not sufficient faith to work the miracle with the first blow. Cf
⇒
 Numbers 20:12.
3
 [12-13] The sin of Moses and Aaron
consisted in doubting God's mercy toward the ever-rebellious people. In showing
forth my sanctity: God's sacred power and glory: an allusion to the name of the
place, Kadesh, which means "sanctified, sacred." Meribah means
"contention." Cf
⇒
 Exodus 17:7.
4
 [14] Your brother Israel: the
Edomites were descended from Esau, the brother of Jacob. Their country, to the
southeast of the Dead Sea, was also known as Seir; cf
⇒
 Genesis 25:24-26;
⇒
 36:1; 8- 9.
5
 [17] The royal road: an important
highway, running north and south along the plateau east of the Dead Sea. In
ancient times it was much used by caravans and armies; later it was improved by
the Romans, and large stretches of it are still clearly recognizable.
6
 [22] Mount Hor: not definitively
identified, but probably to be sought in the vicinity of Kadesh. According to
⇒
 Deut 10:6 Aaron died at Moserah (cf
"Moseroth" in 
⇒
 Numbers 33:30-31), which
is apparently the name of the region in which Mount Hor is situated.
