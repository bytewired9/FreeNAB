 Now the Reubenites and Gadites had a very
large number of livestock. Noticing that the land of Jazer and of Gilead was
grazing country, 
2
they came to Moses and the priest Eleazar and
to the princes of the community and said, 
3
[2]
 "The region of Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer,
Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Baal-meon, 
4
which the LORD has laid low before the
community of Israel, is grazing country. Now, since your servants have
livestock," 
5
they continued, "if we find favor with
you, let this land be given to your servants as their property. Do not make us
cross the Jordan." 
6
But Moses answered the Gadites and Reubenites:
"Are your kinsmen, then, to engage in war, while you remain here? 
7
Why do you wish to discourage the Israelites
from crossing to the land the LORD has given them? 
8
That is just what your fathers did when I sent
them from Kadesh-barnea to reconnoiter the land. 
9
They went up to the Wadi Eshcol and
reconnoitered the land, then so discouraged the Israelites that they would not
enter the land the LORD had given them. 
10
At that time the wrath of the LORD flared up,
and he swore, 
11
'Because they have not followed me
unreservedly, none of these men of twenty years or more who have come up from
Egypt shall ever see this country I promised under oath to Abraham and Isaac
and Jacob, 
12
[3]
 except the Kenizzite Caleb, son of Jephunneh,
and Joshua, son of Nun, who have followed the LORD unreservedly.' 
13
So in his anger with the Israelites the LORD
made them wander in the desert forty years, until the whole generation that had
done evil in the sight of the LORD had died out. 
14
And now here you are, a brood of sinners,
rising up in your fathers' place to add still more to the LORD'S blazing wrath
against the Israelites. 
15
If you turn away from following him, he will
make them stay still longer in the desert, and so you will bring about the ruin
of this whole nation." 
16
But they were insistent with him: "We wish
only to build sheepfolds here for our flocks, and towns for our families; 
17
but we ourselves will march as troops in the
van of the Israelites, until we have led them to their destination. Meanwhile
our families can remain here in the fortified towns, safe from attack by the
natives. 
18
We will not return to our homes until every one
of the Israelites has taken possession of his heritage, 
19
and will not claim any heritage with them once
we cross the Jordan, so long as we receive a heritage for ourselves on this
eastern side of the Jordan." 
20
[4]
 Moses said to them in reply: "If you keep
your word to march as troops in the LORD'S vanguard 
21
and to cross the Jordan in full force before
the LORD until he has driven his enemies out of his way 
22
and the land is subdued before him, then you
may return here, quit of every obligation to the LORD and to Israel, and this
region shall be your possession before the LORD. 
23
But if you do not do this, you will sin against
the LORD, and you can be sure that you will not escape the consequences of your
sin. 
24
Build the towns, then, for your families, and
the folds for your flocks, but also fulfill your express promise." 
25
The Gadites and Reubenites answered Moses,
"Your servants will do as you command, my lord. 
26
While our wives and children, our herds and
other livestock remain in the towns of Gilead, 
27
all your servants will go across as armed
troops to battle before the LORD, just as your lordship says." 
28
Moses, therefore, gave this order in their
regard to the priest Eleazar, to Joshua, son of Nun, and to the heads of the
ancestral tribes of the Israelites: 
29
"If all the Gadites and Reubenites cross
the Jordan with you as combat troops before the LORD, you shall give them
Gilead as their property when the land has been subdued before you. 
30
But if they will not go across with you as
combat troops before the LORD, you shall bring their wives and children and
livestock across before you into Canaan, and they shall have their property
with you in the land of Canaan." 
31
To this the Gadites and Reubenites replied,
"We will do what the LORD has commanded us, your servants. 
32
We ourselves will go across into the land of
Canaan as troops before the LORD, but we will retain our hereditary property on
this side of the Jordan." 
33
[5]
 So Moses gave them (the Gadites and
Reubenites, as well as half the tribe of Manasseh, son of Joseph, the kingdom
of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan,) the
land with its towns and the districts that surrounded them. 
34
The Gadites rebuilt the fortified towns of
Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 
35
Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 
36
Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran, and they built
sheepfolds. 
37
The Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh,
Kiriathaim, 
38
[6]
 Nebo, Baal-meon (names to be changed!), and
Sibmah. These towns, which they rebuilt, they called by their old names. 
39
The descendants of Machir, son of Manasseh,
invaded Gilead and captured it, driving out the Amorites who were there. 
40
(Moses gave Gilead to Machir, son of Manasseh,
and he settled there.) 
41
Jair, a Manassehite clan, campaigned against
the tent villages, captured them and called them Havvoth-jair. 
42
Nobah also campaigned against Kenath, captured
it with its dependencies and called it Nobah after his own name. 
1
 [1] Gilead: the name of the western
part of the plateau east of the Jordan, sometimes signifying the whole region
from the Yarmuk to the Jordan, sometimes only the northern part of this region,
and sometimes, as here, only its southern part. Jazer lay to the east of
southern Gilead.
2
 [3] The places named in this verse,
as well as the additional ones given in 
⇒
32:34-38, were all in the former kingdom of Sihon, that is, in the
region between the Jabbok and the Arnon. Cf 
⇒
21:23, 
⇒
 24; 
⇒
 Joshua
13:19-21, 
⇒
 24-27.
3
 [12] Kenizzite: a member of the
clan of Kenaz, which, according to 
⇒
 Genesis 36:11,
⇒
 15, 
⇒
 42, was
Edomitic; hence, although Caleb belonged to the tribe of Judah
(
⇒
13:6;
⇒
 34:19), he must have had Edomite
blood in his veins; cf also 
⇒
 Joshua 14:6,
⇒
 14.
4
 [20-22] Since the ark of the Lord
was borne into battle with the Israelite army, the vanguard was said to march
before the Lord.
5
 [33] The preceding is concerned
solely with the two tribes of Gad and Reuben and with the land of the former
kingdom of Sihon; hence it seems probable that the sudden reference here to the
half-tribe of Manasseh and to their territory in Bashan, the former kingdom of
Og, is a later addition to the text.
6
 [38] The phrase in brackets is a
gloss, warning the reader either to change the order of the preceding names,
or, more probably, to read some other word, such as bosheth, "shame,"
for Baal. They called by their old names: literally, "they called by their
names" (see Textual Notes); however, some understand the current Hebrew
text to mean, "they called by new names."
