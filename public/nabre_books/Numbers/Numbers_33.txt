[1]
 The following are the stages by which the
Israelites journeyed up by companies from the land of Egypt under the guidance
of Moses and Aaron. 
2
By the LORD'S command Moses recorded the
starting places of the various stages. The starting places of the successive
stages were: 
3
[2]
 They set out from Rameses in the first month,
on the fifteenth day of the first month. On the Passover morrow the Israelites
went forth in triumph, in view of all Egypt, 
4
While the Egyptians buried their first-born all
of whom the LORD had struck down; on their gods, too, the LORD executed
judgments. 
5
Setting out from Rameses, the Israelites camped
at Succoth. 
6
Setting out from Succoth, they camped at Etham
near the edge of the desert. 
7
Setting out from Etham, they turned back to
Pi-hahiroth, which is opposite Baal-zephon, and they camped opposite Migdol. 
8
Setting out from Pi-hahiroth, they crossed over
through the sea into the desert, and after a three days' journey in the desert of
Etham, they camped at Marah. 
9
Setting out from Marah, they came to Elim,
where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they
camped there. 
10
Setting out from Elim, they camped beside the
Red Sea. 
11
Setting out from the Red Sea, they camped in
the desert of Sin.

at Dophkah. 
13

14

Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink. 
15
Setting out from Rephidim, they camped in the
desert of Sinai. 
16
Setting out from the desert of Sinai, they
camped at Kibroth-hattaavah. 
17
Setting out from Kibroth-hattaavah, they camped
at Hazeroth. 
18
Setting out from Hazeroth, they camped at
Rithmah. 
19
Setting out from Rithmah, they camped at
Rimmon-perez. 
20
Setting out from Rimmon-perez, they camped at
Libnah. 
21
Setting out from Libnah, they camped at Rissah.
22
Setting out from Rissah, they camped at
Kehelathah. 
23
Setting out from Kehelathah, they camped at
Mount Shepher. 
24
Setting out from Mount Shepher, they camped at
Haradah. 
25
Setting out from Haradah, they camped at
Makheloth. 
26
Setting out from Makheloth, they camped at

27
Setting out from Tahath, they camped at Terah. 
28
Setting out from Terah, they camped at Mithkah.
29
Setting out from Mithkah, they camped at
Hashmonah. 
30
[3]
 Setting out from Hashmonah,-They camped at
Moseroth. 
31
Setting out from Moseroth, they camped at
Bene-jaakan. 
32
Setting out from Bene-jaakan, they camped at
Mount Gidgad. 
33
Setting out from Mount Gidgad, they camped at
Jotbathah. 
34
Setting out from Jotbathah, they camped at
Abronah. 
35
Setting out from Abronah, they camped at
Ezion-geber. 
36
Setting out from Ezion-geber,-They camped in
the desert of Zin, at Kadesh. 
37
Setting out from Kadesh, they camped at Mount
Hor on the border of the land of Edom. 
38
(Aaron the priest ascended Mount Hor at the
LORD'S command, and there he died in the fortieth year from the departure of
the Israelites from the land of Egypt, on the first day of the fifth month. 
39
Aaron was a hundred and twenty-three years old
when he died on Mount Hor. 
40
[4]
 Now, when the Canaanite king of Arad, who
lived in the Negeb in the land of Canaan, heard that the Israelites were
coming. . . . ) 
41
[5]
 Setting out from Mount Hor,-They camped at
Zalmonah. 
42
Setting out from Zalmonah, they camped at
Punon. 
43

Almon-diblathaim. 
47
Setting out from Almon-diblathaim, they camped
in the Abarim Mountains opposite Nebo. 
48
Setting out from the Abarim Mountains, they
camped on the plains of Moab along the Jericho stretch of the Jordan. 
49
Their camp along the Jordan on the plains of
Moab extended from Beth-jeshimoth to Abelshittim. 
50
The LORD spoke to Moses on the plains of Moab
beside the Jericho stretch of the Jordan and said to him: 
51
"Tell the Israelites: When you go across
the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
52
drive out all the inhabitants of the land
before you; destroy all their stone figures and molten images, and demolish all
their high places. 
53
"You shall take possession of the land and
settle in it, for I have given you the land as your property. 
54
You shall apportion the land among yourselves
by lot, clan by clan, assigning a large heritage to a large group and a small
heritage to a small group. Wherever anyone's lot falls, there shall his
property be within the heritage of his ancestral tribe. 
55
"But if you do not drive out the
inhabitants of the land before you, those whom you allow to remain will become
as barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they will harass you in the
country where you live, 
56
and I will treat you as I had intended to treat
them."

 [1-3] This list of camping sites
was drawn up by Moses, as 
⇒
 Numbers 33:2 expressly
states. However, in its present form it probably includes some glosses.
Moreover, a comparison with the more detailed accounts of the journey as given
elsewhere shows that this list is not complete. It records just forty camping
sites, not counting the starting place, Rameses, and the terminus, the plains
of Moab. This number, which corresponds exactly to the forty years of wandering
in the desert, is probably a schematic device. Besides, it seems that in its
present form the order of some of these names has been disturbed. Several names
listed here are not recorded elsewhere.
2
 [3-4] These two verses were
probably borrowed from some ancient song celebrating the exodus from Egypt.
3
 [30-36] Moseroth is mentioned in
⇒
 Deut 10:6 (in the form of "Moserah"), as
the place where Aaron died. It must therefore have been close to Mount Hor; cf
⇒
 Numbers 20:22-24. It seems very probable that the
section 
⇒
 Numbers 33:36b-41a stood orginally
immediately after 
⇒
 Numbers 33:30a.
4
 [40] The verse begins the same account
of the victory over Arad as is given in 
⇒
21:1-3, where it also follows the account of Aaron's death.
5
 [41b-49] It seems that this section
stood originally immediately after 
⇒
 Numbers 33:36a.
