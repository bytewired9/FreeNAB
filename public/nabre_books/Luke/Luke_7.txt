[2]
 When he had finished all
his words to the people, he entered Capernaum. 
2
A centurion 
[3]
 there had a slave
who was ill and about to die, and he was valuable to him. 
3
When he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of
the Jews to him, asking him to come and save the life of his slave. 
4
They approached Jesus and strongly urged him to
come, saying, "He deserves to have you do this for him, 
5
for he loves our nation and he built the
synagogue for us." 
6
And Jesus went with them, but when he was only
a short distance from the house, the centurion sent friends to tell him,
"Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you enter
under my roof. 
[4]
7
Therefore, I did not consider myself worthy to
come to you; but say the word and let my servant be healed. 
8
For I too am a person subject to authority,
with soldiers subject to me. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to
another, 'Come here,' and he comes; and to my slave, 'Do this,' and he does
it." 
9
When Jesus heard this he was amazed at him and,
turning, said to the crowd following him, "I tell you, not even in Israel
have I found such faith." 
10
When the messengers returned to the house, they
found the slave in good health. 
11
[5]
 Soon afterward he journeyed to a city called
Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd accompanied him. 
12
As he drew near to the gate of the city, a man
who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a
widow. A large crowd from the city was with her. 
13
When the Lord saw her, he was moved with pity
for her and said to her, "Do not weep." 
14
He stepped forward and touched the coffin; at
this the bearers halted, and he said, "Young man, I tell you, arise!"
15
The dead man sat up and began to speak, and
Jesus gave him to his mother. 
16
Fear seized them all, and they glorified God,
exclaiming, "A great prophet has arisen in our midst," and "God
has visited his people." 
17
This report about him spread through the whole
of Judea and in all the surrounding region. 
18
[6]
 The disciples of John told him about all these
things. John summoned two of his disciples 
19
and sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are you
the one who is to come, or should we look for another?" 
20
When the men came to him, they said, "John
the Baptist has sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the one who is to come, or
should we look for another?'" 
21
At that time he cured many of their diseases,
sufferings, and evil spirits; he also granted sight to many who were blind. 
22
And he said to them in reply, "Go and tell
John what you have seen and heard: the blind regain their sight, the lame walk,
lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the good
news proclaimed to them. 
23
And blessed is the one who takes no offense at
me." 
[7]
24
[8]
 When the messengers of John had left, Jesus
began to speak to the crowds about John. "What did you go out to the
desert to see - a reed swayed by the wind? 
25
Then what did you go out to see? Someone
dressed in fine garments? Those who dress luxuriously and live sumptuously are
found in royal palaces. 
26
Then what did you go out to see? A prophet?
Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. 
27
This is the one about whom scripture says:
'Behold, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, he will prepare your way
before you.' 
28
I tell you, among those born of women, no one
is greater than John; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than
he." 
29
(All the people who listened, including the tax
collectors, and who were baptized with the baptism of John, acknowledged the
righteousness of God; 
30
but the Pharisees and scholars of the law, who were
not baptized by him, rejected the plan of God for themselves.) 
31
[9]
 "Then to what shall I compare the people
of this generation? What are they like? 
32
They are like children who sit in the
marketplace and call to one another, 'We played the flute for you, but you did
not dance. We sang a dirge, but you did not weep.' 
33
For John the Baptist came neither eating food
nor drinking wine, and you said, 'He is possessed by a demon.' 
34
The Son of Man came eating and drinking and you
said, 'Look, he is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and
sinners.' 
35
But wisdom is vindicated by all her
children." 
36
[10]
[11]
 A Pharisee invited him
to dine with him, and he entered the Pharisee's house and reclined at table. 
37
Now there was a sinful woman in the city who
learned that he was at table in the house of the Pharisee. Bringing an
alabaster flask of ointment, 
38
she stood behind him at his feet weeping and
began to bathe his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair,
kissed them, and anointed them with the ointment. 
39
When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this
he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who and
what sort of woman this is who is touching him, that she is a sinner." 
40
Jesus said to him in reply, "Simon, I have
something to say to you." "Tell me, teacher," he said. 
41
"Two people were in debt to a certain
creditor; one owed five hundred days' wages 
[12]
 and the other
owed fifty. 
42
Since they were unable to repay the debt, he
forgave it for both. Which of them will love him more?" 
43
Simon said in reply, "The one, I suppose,
whose larger debt was forgiven." He said to him, "You have judged
rightly." 
44
Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon,
"Do you see this woman? When I entered your house, you did not give me
water for my feet, but she has bathed them with her tears and wiped them with
her hair. 
45
You did not give me a kiss, but she has not
ceased kissing my feet since the time I entered. 
46
You did not anoint my head with oil, but she
anointed my feet with ointment. 
47
So I tell you, her many sins have been
forgiven; hence, she has shown great love. 
[13]
 But the one to
whom little is forgiven, loves little." 
48
He said to her, "Your sins are
forgiven." 
49
The others at table said to themselves,
"Who is this who even forgives sins?" 
50
But he said to the woman, "Your faith has
saved you; go in peace."

[

 7:1-
⇒
 8:3] The episodes
in this section present a series of reactions to the Galilean ministry of Jesus
and reflect some of Luke's particular interests: the faith of a Gentile (
⇒
7:1-10); the prophet Jesus' concern for a widowed mother
(
⇒
 Luke 7:11-17); the ministry of Jesus directed to
the afflicted and unfortunate of 
⇒
 Isaiah 61:1
(
⇒
 Luke 7:18-23); the relation between John and
Jesus and their role in God's plan for salvation (
⇒
7:24-35); a forgiven sinner's manifestation of love
(
⇒
 Luke 7:36-50); the association of women with the
ministry of Jesus (
⇒
 Luke 8:1-3).
2
 [1-10] This story about the faith
of the centurion, a Gentile who cherishes the Jewish nation
(
⇒
 Luke 7:5), prepares for the story in Acts of the
conversion by Peter of the Roman centurion Cornelius who is similarly described
as one who is generous to the Jewish nation (
⇒
 Acts
10:2). See also 
⇒
 Acts 10:34-35 in the
speech of Peter: "God shows no partiality . . . the person who fears him
and acts righteously is acceptable to him." See also the notes on
⇒
 Matthew 8:5-13 and 
⇒
 John
4:43-54. 
3
 [2] A centurion: see the note on 
⇒
 Matthew
8:5.
4
 [6] I am not worthy to have you
enter under my roof: to enter the house of a Gentile was considered unclean for
a Jew; cf 
⇒
 Acts 10:28.
5
 [11-17] In the previous incident
Jesus' power was displayed for a Gentile whose servant was dying; in this
episode it is displayed toward a widowed mother whose only son has already
died. Jesus' power over death prepares for his reply to John's disciples in
⇒
 Luke 7:22: "the dead are raised." This
resuscitation in alluding to the prophet Elijah's resurrection of the only son
of a widow of Zarephath (
⇒
 1 Kings 7:8-24) leads to
the reaction of the crowd: "A great prophet has arisen in our midst"
(
⇒
 Luke 7:16).
6
 [18-23] In answer to John's
question, Are you the one who is to come? - a probable reference to the return
of the fiery prophet of reform, Elijah, "before the day of the Lord comes,
the great and terrible day" (
⇒
 Malachi 3:23) -
Jesus responds that his role is rather to bring the blessings spoken of in
⇒
 Isaiah 61:1 to the oppressed and neglected of
society (
⇒
 Luke 7:22; cf 
⇒
4:18).
7
 [23] Blessed is the one who takes
no offense at me: this beatitude is pronounced on the person who recognizes
Jesus' true identity in spite of previous expectations of what "the one
who is to come" would be like.
8
 [24-30] In his testimony to John,
Jesus reveals his understanding of the relationship between them: John is the
precursor of Jesus (
⇒
 Luke 7:27); John is the
messenger spoken of in 
⇒
 Malachi 3:1 who in
⇒
 Malachi 3:23 is identified as Elijah. Taken with
the previous episode, it can be seen that Jesus identifies John as precisely
the person John envisioned Jesus to be: the Elijah who prepares the way for the
coming of the day of the Lord.
9
 [31-35] See the note on
⇒
 Matthew 11:16-19.
10
 [36-50] In this story of the
pardoning of the sinful woman Luke presents two different reactions to the
ministry of Jesus. A Pharisee, suspecting Jesus to be a prophet, invites Jesus
to a festive banquet in his house, but the Pharisee's self-righteousness leads
to little forgiveness by God and consequently little love shown toward Jesus.
The sinful woman, on the other hand, manifests a faith in God
(
⇒
 Luke 7:50) that has led her to seek forgiveness
for her sins, and because so much was forgiven, she now overwhelms Jesus with
her display of love; cf the similar contrast in attitudes in 
⇒
18:9-14. The whole episode is a powerful lesson on the relation
between forgiveness and love.
11
 [36] Reclined at table: the normal
posture of guests at a banquet. Other oriental banquet customs alluded to in
this story include the reception by the host with a kiss
(
⇒
 Luke 7:45), washing the feet of the guests
(
⇒
 Luke 7:44), and the anointing of the guests'
heads (
⇒
 Luke 7:46).
12
 [41] Days' wages: one denarius is
the normal daily wage of a laborer.
13
 [47] Her many sins have been
forgiven; hence, she has shown great love: literally, "her many sins have
been forgiven, seeing that she has loved much." That the woman's sins have
been forgiven is attested by the great love she shows toward Jesus. Her love is
the consequence of her forgiveness. This is also the meaning demanded by the
parable in 
⇒
 Luke 7:41-43.
