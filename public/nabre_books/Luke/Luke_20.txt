[1]
 One day as he was teaching the people in the
temple area and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and scribes,
together with the elders, approached him 
2
and said to him, "Tell us, by what
authority are you doing these things? Or who is the one who gave you this
authority?" 
3
He said to them in reply, "I shall ask you
a question. Tell me, 
4
was John's baptism of heavenly or of human
origin?" 
5
They discussed this among themselves, and said,
"If we say, 'Of heavenly origin,' he will say, 'Why did you not believe
him?' 
6
But if we say, 'Of human origin,' then all the
people will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet." 
7
So they answered that they did not know from
where it came. 
8
Then Jesus said to them, "Neither shall I
tell you by what authority I do these things." 
9
[2]
 Then he proceeded to tell the people this
parable. "(A) man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and
then went on a journey for a long time. 
10
At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenant
farmers to receive some of the produce of the vineyard. But they beat the
servant and sent him away empty-handed. 
11
So he proceeded to send another servant, but
him also they beat and insulted and sent away empty-handed. 
12
Then he proceeded to send a third, but this one
too they wounded and threw out. 
13
The owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I
do? I shall send my beloved son; maybe they will respect him.' 
14
But when the tenant farmers saw him they said
to one another, 'This is the heir. Let us kill him that the inheritance may
become ours.' 
15
So they threw him out of the vineyard and
killed him. 
[3]
 What will the owner of the vineyard do to
them? 
16
He will come and put those tenant farmers to
death and turn over the vineyard to others." When the people heard this,
they exclaimed, "Let it not be so!" 
17
But he looked at them and asked, "What
then does this scripture passage mean: 'The stone which the builders rejected
has become the cornerstone'? 
18
Everyone who falls on that stone will be dashed
to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls." 
19
The scribes and chief priests sought to lay
their hands on him at that very hour, but they feared the people, for they knew
that he had addressed this parable to them. 
20
[4]
 They watched him closely and sent agents
pretending to be righteous who were to trap him in speech, in order to hand him
over to the authority and power of the governor. 
21
They posed this question to him, "Teacher,
we know that what you say and teach is correct, and you show no partiality, but
teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. 
22
Is it lawful for us to pay tribute to Caesar or
not?" 
[5]
23
Recognizing their craftiness he said to them, 
24
"Show me a denarius; 
[6]
whose image and name does it bear?" They replied, "Caesar's." 
25
So he said to them, "Then repay to Caesar
what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God." 
26
They were unable to trap him by something he
might say before the people, and so amazed were they at his reply that they
fell silent. 
27
Some Sadducees, 
[7]
 those who
deny that there is a resurrection, came forward and put this question to him, 
28
[8]
 saying, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us, 'If
someone's brother dies leaving a wife but no child, his brother must take the
wife and raise up descendants for his brother.' 
29
Now there were seven brothers; the first
married a woman but died childless. 
30
Then the second 
31
and the third married her, and likewise all the
seven died childless. 
32
Finally the woman also died. 
33
Now at the resurrection whose wife will that
woman be? For all seven had been married to her." 
34
Jesus said to them, "The children of this
age marry and remarry; 
35
but those who are deemed worthy to attain to
the coming age and to the resurrection of the dead neither marry nor are given
in marriage. 
36
They can no longer die, for they are like
angels; and they are the children of God because they are the ones who will
rise. 
[9]
37
That the dead will rise even Moses made known
in the passage about the bush, when he called 'Lord' the God of Abraham, the
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; 
38
and he is not God of the dead, but of the
living, for to him all are alive." 
39
Some of the scribes said in reply,
"Teacher, you have answered well." 
40
And they no longer dared to ask him anything. 
41
[10]
 Then he said to them, "How do they claim
that the Messiah is the Son of David? 
42
For David himself in the Book of Psalms says:
'The Lord said to my lord, "Sit at my right hand 
43
till I make your enemies your footstool."'
44
Now if David calls him 'lord,' how can he be
his son?" 
45
Then, within the hearing of all the people, he
said to (his) disciples, 
46
"Be on guard against the scribes, who like
to go around in long robes and love greetings in marketplaces, seats of honor
in synagogues, and places of honor at banquets. 
47
They devour the houses of widows and, as a
pretext, recite lengthy prayers. They will receive a very severe
condemnation." 
1
 [1-47] The Jerusalem religious
leaders or their representatives, in an attempt to incriminate Jesus with the
Romans and to discredit him with the people, pose a number of questions to him
(about his authority, 2; about payment of taxes, 
⇒
20:22; about the resurrection, 
⇒
20:28-33). 
2
 [9-19] This parable about an
absentee landlord and a tenant farmers' revolt reflects the social and economic
conditions of rural Palestine in the first century. The synoptic gospel writers
use the parable to describe how the rejection of the landlord's son becomes the
occasion for the vineyard to be taken away from those to whom it was entrusted
(the religious leadership of Judaism that rejects the teaching and preaching of
Jesus; 
⇒
 Luke 20:19).
3
 [15] They threw him out of the
vineyard and killed him: cf 
⇒
 Mark 12:8. Luke has
altered his Marcan source and reports that the murder of the son takes place
outside the vineyard to reflect the tradition of Jesus' death outside the walls
of the city of Jerusalem (see 
⇒
 Hebrews 13:12).
4
 [20] The governor: i.e., Pontius
Pilate, the Roman administrator responsible for the collection of taxes and
maintenance of order in Palestine.
5
 [22] Through their question the
agents of the Jerusalem religious leadership hope to force Jesus to take sides
on one of the sensitive political issues of first-century Palestine. The issue
of nonpayment of taxes to Rome becomes one of the focal points of the First
Jewish Revolt (A.D. 66-70) that resulted in the Roman destruction of Jerusalem
and the temple. See also the note on 
⇒
 Matthew 22:15-22.
6
 [24] Denarius: a Roman silver coin
(see the note on 
⇒
 Luke 7:41).
7
 [27] Sadducees: see the note on
⇒
 Matthew 3:7.
8
 [28-33] The Sadducees' question,
based on the law of levirate marriage recorded in 
⇒
 Deut
25:5-10, ridicules the idea of the resurrection. Jesus rejects their
naive understanding of the resurrection (
⇒
20:35-36) and then argues on behalf of the resurrection of the dead
on the basis of the written law (
⇒
 Luke 20:37-38)
that the Sadducees accept. See also the notes on 
⇒
 Matthew
22:23-33.
9
 [36] Because they are the ones who
will rise: literally, "being sons of the resurrection."
10
 [41-44] After successfully
answering the three questions of his opponents, Jesus now asks them a question.
Their inability to respond implies that they have forfeited their position and
authority as the religious leaders of the people because they do not understand
the scriptures. This series of controversies between the religious leadership
of Jerusalem and Jesus reveals Jesus as the authoritative teacher whose words
are to be listened to (see 
⇒
 Luke 9:35). See also
the notes on 
⇒
 Matthew 22:41-46.
