He said to his disciples, "Things that
cause sin will inevitably occur, but woe to the person through whom they occur.
2
It would be better for him if a millstone were
put around his neck and he be thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of
these little ones to sin. 
3
Be on your guard! 
[1]
 If your
brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. 
4
And if he wrongs you seven times in one day and
returns to you seven times saying, 'I am sorry,' you should forgive him." 
5
And the apostles said to the Lord,
"Increase our faith." 
6
The Lord replied, "If you have faith the
size of a mustard seed, you would say to (this) mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and
planted in the sea,' and it would obey you. 
7
[2]
 "Who among you would say to your servant
who has just come in from plowing or tending sheep in the field, 'Come here
immediately and take your place at table'? 
8
Would he not rather say to him, 'Prepare
something for me to eat. Put on your apron and wait on me while I eat and
drink. You may eat and drink when I am finished'? 
9
Is he grateful to that servant because he did
what was commanded? 
10
So should it be with you. When you have done
all you have been commanded, say, 'We are unprofitable servants; we have done
what we were obliged to do.'" 
11

[4]
 As he continued his
journey to Jerusalem, he traveled through Samaria and Galilee. 
12
As he was entering a village, ten lepers met
(him). They stood at a distance from him 
13
and raised their voice, saying, "Jesus,
Master! Have pity on us!" 
14
And when he saw them, he said, "Go show
yourselves to the priests." 
[5]
 As they were going they
were cleansed. 
15
And one of them, realizing he had been healed,
returned, glorifying God in a loud voice; 
16
and he fell at the feet of Jesus and thanked
him. He was a Samaritan. 
17
Jesus said in reply, "Ten were cleansed,
were they not? Where are the other nine? 
18
Has none but this foreigner returned to give
thanks to God?" 
19
Then he said to him, "Stand up and go;
your faith has saved you." 
20
[6]
 Asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God
would come, he said in reply, "The coming of the kingdom of God cannot be
observed, 
21
[7]
 and no one will announce, 'Look, here it is,'
or, 'There it is.' For behold, the kingdom of God is among you." 
22
Then he said to his disciples, "The days
will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you
will not see it. 
23
There will be those who will say to you, 'Look,
there he is,' (or) 'Look, here he is.' Do not go off, do not run in pursuit. 
24
For just as lightning flashes and lights up the
sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be (in his day). 
25
But first he must suffer greatly and be
rejected by this generation. 
26
As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in
the days of the Son of Man; 
27
they were eating and drinking, marrying and
giving in marriage up to the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came
and destroyed them all. 
28
Similarly, as it was in the days of Lot: they
were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building; 
29
on the day when Lot left Sodom, fire and
brimstone rained from the sky to destroy them all. 
30
So it will be on the day the Son of Man is
revealed. 
31
On that day, a person who is on the housetop
and whose belongings are in the house must not go down to get them, and
likewise a person in the field must not return to what was left behind. 
32
Remember the wife of Lot. 
33
Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose
it, but whoever loses it will save it. 
34
I tell you, on that night there will be two
people in one bed; one will be taken, the other left. 
35
And there will be two women grinding meal
together; one will be taken, the other left." 
36
[8]
37
They said to him in reply, "Where,
Lord?" He said to them, "Where the body is, there also the vultures
will gather."

 [3] Be on your guard: the
translation takes 
⇒
 Luke 17:3a as the conclusion to
the saying on scandal in 
⇒
 Luke 17:1-2. It is not
impossible that it should be taken as the beginning of the saying on
forgiveness in 
⇒
 Luke 17:3b-4. 
2
 [7-10] These sayings of Jesus,
peculiar to Luke, which continue his response to the apostles' request to
increase their faith (
⇒
 Luke 17:5-6), remind them
that Christian disciples can make no claim on God's graciousness; in fulfilling
the exacting demands of discipleship, they are only doing their duty.
3
 [11-19] This incident recounting
the thankfulness of the cleansed Samaritan leper is narrated only in Luke's
gospel and provides an instance of Jesus holding up a non-Jew
(
⇒
 Luke 17:18) as an example to his Jewish
contemporaries (cf 
⇒
 Luke 10:33 where a similar
purpose is achieved in the story of the good Samaritan). Moreover, it is the
faith in Jesus manifested by the foreigner that has brought him salvation
(
⇒
 Luke 17:19; cf the similar relationship between
faith and salvation in 
⇒
 Luke 7:50;
⇒
 8:48, 
⇒
 50).

 [11] Through Samaria and Galilee:
or, "between Samaria and Galilee."

 [14] See the note on
⇒
 Luke 5:14.
6
 [20-37] To the question of the
Pharisees about the time of the coming of God's kingdom, Jesus replies that the
kingdom is among you (
⇒
 Luke 17:20-21). The emphasis
has thus been shifted from an imminent observable coming of the kingdom to
something that is already present in Jesus' preaching and healing ministry.
Luke has also appended further traditional sayings of Jesus about the
unpredictable suddenness of the day of the Son of Man, and assures his readers
that in spite of the delay of that day (
⇒
12:45), it will bring judgment unexpectedly on those who do not
continue to be vigilant.
7
 [21] Among you: the Greek preposition
translated as among can also be translated as "within." In the light
of other statements in Luke's gospel about the presence of the kingdom (see
⇒
 Luke 10:9, 
⇒
 11;
⇒
 11:20) "among" is to be preferred.
8
 [36] The inclusion of
⇒
 Luke 17:36 "There will be two men in the
field; one will be taken, the other left behind," in some Western
manuscripts appears to be a scribal assimilation to 
⇒
 Matthew
24:40.
