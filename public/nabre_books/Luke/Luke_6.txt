[1]
 While he was going through a field of grain on
a sabbath, his disciples were picking the heads of grain, rubbing them in their
hands, and eating them. 
2
Some Pharisees said, "Why are you doing
what is unlawful on the sabbath?" 
3
Jesus said to them in reply, "Have you not
read what David did when he and those (who were) with him were hungry? 
4
(How) he went into the house of God, took the
bread of offering, 
[2]
 which only the priests could lawfully
eat, ate of it, and shared it with his companions." 
5
Then he said to them, "The Son of Man is
lord of the sabbath." 
6
On another sabbath he went into the synagogue
and taught, and there was a man there whose right hand was withered. 
7
The scribes and the Pharisees watched him
closely to see if he would cure on the sabbath so that they might discover a
reason to accuse him. 
8
But he realized their intentions and said to
the man with the withered hand, "Come up and stand before us." And he
rose and stood there. 
9
Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you, is it
lawful to do good on the sabbath rather than to do evil, to save life rather
than to destroy it?" 
10
Looking around at them all, he then said to
him, "Stretch out your hand." He did so and his hand was restored. 
11
But they became enraged and discussed together
what they might do to Jesus. 
12
[3]
 In those days he departed to the mountain to
pray, and he spent the night in prayer 
[4]
 to God. 
13
When day came, he called his disciples to
himself, and from them he chose Twelve, 
[5]
 whom he also named
apostles: 
14
Simon, whom he named Peter, 
[6]
and his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, 
15
Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus,
Simon who was called a Zealot, 
[7]
16
and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot,
[8]
 who became a traitor. 
17
[9]
 And he came down with them and stood on a stretch
of level ground. A great crowd of his disciples and a large number of the
people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon 
18
came to hear him and to be healed of their
diseases; and even those who were tormented by unclean spirits were cured. 
19
Everyone in the crowd sought to touch him
because power came forth from him and healed them all. 
20
[10]
[11]
 And raising his eyes
toward his disciples he said: "Blessed are you who are poor, for the
kingdom of God is yours. 
21
Blessed are you who are now hungry, for you
will be satisfied. Blessed are you who are now weeping, for you will laugh. 
22
Blessed are you when people hate you, and when
they exclude and insult you, and denounce your name as evil on account of the
Son of Man. 
23
Rejoice and leap for joy on that day! Behold,
your reward will be great in heaven. For their ancestors treated the prophets in
the same way. 
24
But woe to you who are rich, for you have
received your consolation. 
25
But woe to you who are filled now, for you will
be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will grieve and weep. 
26
Woe to you when all speak well of you, for
their ancestors treated the false prophets in this way. 
27
[12]
 "But to you who hear I say, love your
enemies, do good to those who hate you, 
28
bless those who curse you, pray for those who
mistreat you. 
29
To the person who strikes you on one cheek,
offer the other one as well, and from the person who takes your cloak, do not
withhold even your tunic. 
30
Give to everyone who asks of you, and from the
one who takes what is yours do not demand it back. 
31
Do to others as you would have them do to you. 
32
For if you love those who love you, what credit
is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. 
33
And if you do good to those who do good to you,
what credit is that to you? Even sinners do the same. 
34
If you lend money to those from whom you expect
repayment, what credit (is) that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, and get
back the same amount. 
35
But rather, love your enemies and do good to
them, and lend expecting nothing back; then your reward will be great and you
will be children of the Most High, for he himself is kind to the ungrateful and
the wicked. 
36
Be merciful, just as (also) your Father is
merciful. 
37
[13]
 "Stop judging and you will not be judged.
Stop condemning and you will not be condemned. Forgive and you will be
forgiven. 
38
Give and gifts will be given to you; a good
measure, packed together, shaken down, and overflowing, will be poured into
your lap. For the measure with which you measure will in return be measured out
to you." 
39
And he told them a parable, "Can a blind
person guide a blind person? Will not both fall into a pit? 
40
No disciple is superior to the teacher; but
when fully trained, every disciple will be like his teacher. 
41
Why do you notice the splinter in your
brother's eye, but do not perceive the wooden beam in your own? 
42
How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let
me remove that splinter in your eye,' when you do not even notice the wooden
beam in your own eye? You hypocrite! Remove the wooden beam from your eye
first; then you will see clearly to remove the splinter in your brother's eye. 
43
[14]
 "A good tree does not bear rotten fruit,
nor does a rotten tree bear good fruit. 
44
For every tree is known by its own fruit. For
people do not pick figs from thornbushes, nor do they gather grapes from
brambles. 
45
A good person out of the store of goodness in
his heart produces good, but an evil person out of a store of evil produces
evil; for from the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks. 
46
"Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' but not
do what I command? 
47
[15]
 I will show you what someone is like who comes
to me, listens to my words, and acts on them. 
48
That one is like a person building a house, who
dug deeply and laid the foundation on rock; when the flood came, the river
burst against that house but could not shake it because it had been well built.
49
But the one who listens and does not act is
like a person who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the
river burst against it, it collapsed at once and was completely destroyed."

 [1-11] The two episodes recounted
here deal with gathering grain and healing, both of which were forbidden on the
sabbath. In his defense of his disciples' conduct and his own charitable deed,
Jesus argues that satisfying human needs such as hunger and performing works of
mercy take precedence even over the sacred sabbath rest. See also the notes on

2:25-26.

 [13] He chose Twelve: the
identification of this group as the Twelve is a part of early Christian
tradition (see 
⇒
 1 Cor 15:5), and in Matthew and
Luke, the Twelve are associated with the twelve tribes of Israel
(
⇒
 Luke 22:29-30; 
⇒
 Matthew
19:28). After the fall of Judas from his position among the Twelve,
the need is felt on the part of the early community to reconstitute this group
before the Christian mission begins at Pentecost (
⇒
 Acts
1:15-26). From Luke's perspective, they are an important group who
because of their association with Jesus from the time of his baptism to his
ascension (
⇒
 Acts 1:21-22) provide the continuity
between the historical Jesus and the church of Luke's day and who as the
original eyewitnesses guarantee the fidelity of the church's beliefs and
practices to the teachings of Jesus (
⇒
 Luke 1:1-4).
Whom he also named apostles: only Luke among the gospel writers attributes to
Jesus the bestowal of the name apostles upon the Twelve. See the note on
⇒
 Matthew 10:2-4. "Apostle" becomes a technical
term in early Christianity for a missionary sent out to preach the word of God.
Although Luke seems to want to restrict the title to the Twelve (only in
⇒
 Acts 4:4, 
⇒
 14 are Paul
and Barnabas termed apostles), other places in the New Testament show an
awareness that the term was more widely applied (
⇒
 1 Cor
15:5-7; 
⇒
 Gal 1:19; 
⇒
 1
Cor 1:1; 
⇒
 9:1;

 Romans
16:7).

 [14] Simon, whom he named Peter:
see the note on 
⇒
 Mark 3:16.
7
 [15] Simon who was called a Zealot:
the Zealots were the instigators of the First Revolt of Palestinian Jews
against Rome in A.D. 66-70. Because the existence of the Zealots as a distinct
group during the lifetime of Jesus is the subject of debate, the meaning of the
identification of Simon as a Zealot is unclear.
8
 [16] Judas Iscariot: the name
Iscariot may mean "man from Kerioth."
9
 [17] The coastal region of Tyre and
Sidon: not only Jews from Judea and Jerusalem, but even Gentiles from outside
Palestine come to hear Jesus (see 
⇒
 Luke 2:31-32;
⇒
 3:6; 
⇒
 4:24-27).
10
 [20-49] Luke's "Sermon on the
Plain" is the counterpart to Matthew's "Sermon on the Mount"
(
⇒
 Matthew 5:1-
⇒
 7:27). It
is addressed to the disciples of Jesus, and, like the sermon in Matthew, it
begins with beatitudes (
⇒
 Luke 6:20-22) and ends
with the parable of the two houses (
⇒
 Luke 6:46-49).
Almost all the words of Jesus reported by Luke are found in Matthew's version,
but because Matthew includes sayings that were related to specifically Jewish
Christian problems (e.g., 
⇒
 Matthew 5:17-20; 
⇒
 6:1-8,
⇒
 16-18) that Luke did not find appropriate for his
predominantly Gentile Christian audience, the "Sermon on the Mount"
is considerably longer. Luke's sermon may be outlined as follows: an introduction
consisting of blessings and woes (
⇒
 Luke 6:20-26);
the love of one's enemies (
⇒
 Matthew 6:27-36); the
demands of loving one's neighbor (
⇒
 Luke 6:37-42);
good deeds as proof of one's goodness (
⇒
6:43-45); a parable illustrating the result of listening to and
acting on the words of Jesus (
⇒
 Luke 6:46-49). At
the core of the sermon is Jesus' teaching on the love of one's enemies
(
⇒
 Luke 6:27-36) that has as its source of
motivation God's graciousness and compassion for all humanity
(
⇒
 Luke 6:35-36) and Jesus' teaching on the love of
one's neighbor (
⇒
 Luke 6:37-42) that is
characterized by forgiveness and generosity.
11
 [20-26] The introductory portion of
the sermon consists of blessings and woes that address the real economic and
social conditions of humanity (the poor - the rich; the hungry - the satisfied;
those grieving - those laughing; the outcast - the socially acceptable). By
contrast, Matthew emphasizes the religious and spiritual values of disciples in
the kingdom inaugurated by Jesus ("poor in spirit," 
⇒
 Matthew
5:5; "hunger and thirst for righteousness,"
⇒
 Matthew 5:6). In the sermon, blessed extols the
fortunate condition of persons who are favored with the blessings of God; the
woes, addressed as they are to the disciples of Jesus, threaten God's profound
displeasure on those so blinded by their present fortunate situation that they
do not recognize and appreciate the real values of God's kingdom. In all the
blessings and woes, the present condition of the persons addressed will be
reversed in the future.
