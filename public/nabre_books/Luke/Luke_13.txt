[2]
 At that time some people
who were present there told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had
mingled with the blood of their sacrifices. 
2
He said to them in reply, "Do you think
that because these Galileans suffered in this way they were greater sinners
than all other Galileans? 
3
By no means! But I tell you, if you do not
repent, you will all perish as they did! 
4
Or those eighteen people who were killed when
the tower at Siloam fell on them 
[3]
  - do you think they were more guilty than everyone else who lived
in Jerusalem? 
5
By no means! But I tell you, if you do not
repent, you will all perish as they did!" 
6
[4]
 And he told them this parable: "There
once was a person who had a fig tree planted in his orchard, and when he came
in search of fruit on it but found none, 
7
he said to the gardener, 'For three years now I
have come in search of fruit on this fig tree but have found none. (So) cut it
down. Why should it exhaust the soil?' 
8
He said to him in reply, 'Sir, leave it for
this year also, and I shall cultivate the ground around it and fertilize it; 
9
it may bear fruit in the future. If not you can
cut it down.'" 
10
[5]
 He was teaching in a synagogue on the sabbath.
11
And a woman was there who for eighteen years
had been crippled by a spirit; she was bent over, completely incapable of
standing erect. 
12
When Jesus saw her, he called to her and said,
"Woman, you are set free of your infirmity." 
13
He laid his hands on her, and she at once stood
up straight and glorified God. 
14
But the leader of the synagogue, indignant that
Jesus had cured on the sabbath, said to the crowd in reply, "There are six
days when work should be done. Come on those days to be cured, not on the
sabbath day." 
15
[6]
 The Lord said to him in reply,
"Hypocrites! Does not each one of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his
ass from the manger and lead it out for watering? 
16
[7]
 This daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound
for eighteen years now, ought she not to have been set free on the sabbath day
from this bondage?" 
17
When he said this, all his adversaries were
humiliated; and the whole crowd rejoiced at all the splendid deeds done by him.
18
[8]
 Then he said, "What is the kingdom of God
like? To what can I compare it? 
19
It is like a mustard seed that a person took
and planted in the garden. When it was fully grown, it became a large bush and
'the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches.'" 
20
Again he said, "To what shall I compare
the kingdom of God? 
21
It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed
(in) with three measures of wheat flour until the whole batch of dough was
leavened." 
22
[9]
 He passed through towns and villages, teaching
as he went and making his way to Jerusalem. 
23
Someone asked him, "Lord, will only a few
people be saved?" He answered them, 
24
"Strive to enter through the narrow gate,
for many, I tell you, will attempt to enter but will not be strong enough. 
25
After the master of the house has arisen and
locked the door, then will you stand outside knocking and saying, 'Lord, open
the door for us.' He will say to you in reply, 'I do not know where you are
from.' 
26
And you will say, 'We ate and drank in your
company and you taught in our streets.' 
27
Then he will say to you, 'I do not know where
(you) are from. Depart from me, all you evildoers!' 
28
And there will be wailing and grinding of teeth
when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of
God and you yourselves cast out. 
29
And people will come from the east and the west
and from the north and the south and will recline at table in the kingdom of
God. 
30
For behold, some are last who will be first, and
some are first who will be last." 
31
At that time some Pharisees came to him and
said, "Go away, leave this area because Herod wants to kill you." 
32
He replied, "Go and tell that fox,
'Behold, I cast out demons and I perform healings today and tomorrow, and on
the third day I accomplish my purpose. 
[10]
33
[11]
 Yet I must continue on my way today, tomorrow,
and the following day, for it is impossible that a prophet should die outside of
Jerusalem.' 
34
"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the
prophets and stone those sent to you, how many times I yearned to gather your
children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you were
unwilling! 
35
Behold, your house will be abandoned. (But) I
tell you, you will not see me until (the time comes when) you say, 'Blessed is
he who comes in the name of the Lord.'" 
1
 [1-5] The death of the Galileans at
the hands of Pilate (
⇒
 Luke 13:1) and the accidental
death of those on whom the tower fell (
⇒
 Luke 13:4)
are presented by the Lucan Jesus as timely reminders of the need for all to
repent, for the victims of these tragedies should not be considered outstanding
sinners who were singled out for punishment.
2
 [1] The slaughter of the Galileans
by Pilate is unknown outside Luke; but from what is known about Pilate from the
Jewish historian Josephus, such a slaughter would be in keeping with the
character of Pilate. Josephus reports that Pilate had disrupted a religious
gathering of the Samaritans on Matthew. Gerizim with a slaughter of the
participants (Antiquities 18, 4, 1 #86-87), and that on another occasion Pilate
had killed many Jews who had opposed him when he appropriated money from the
temple treasury to build an aqueduct in Jerusalem (Jewish War 2, 9, 4 #175-77;
Antiquities 18, 3, 2 #60-62). 
3
 [4] Like the incident mentioned in
⇒
 Luke 13:1 nothing of this accident in Jerusalem is
known outside Luke and the New Testament.
4
 [6-9] Following on the call to
repentance in 
⇒
 Luke 13:1-5, the parable of the barren
fig tree presents a story about the continuing patience of God with those who
have not yet given evidence of their repentance (see 
⇒
3:8). The parable may also be alluding to the delay of the end time,
when punishment will be meted out, and the importance of preparing for the end
of the age because the delay will not be permanent (
⇒
13:8-9).
5
 [10-17] The cure of the crippled
woman on the sabbath and the controversy that results furnishes a parallel to
an incident that will be reported by Luke in
⇒
 14:1-6 the cure of the man with dropsy on the
sabbath. A characteristic of Luke's style is the juxtaposition of an incident
that reveals Jesus' concern for a man with an incident that reveals his concern
for a woman; cf, e.g., 
⇒
 Luke 7:11-17 and
⇒
 Luke 8:49-56.
6
 [15-16] If the law as interpreted
by Jewish tradition allowed for the untying of bound animals on the sabbath,
how much more should this woman who has been bound by Satan's power be freed on
the sabbath from her affliction.
7
 [16] Whom Satan has bound:
affliction and infirmity are taken as evidence of Satan's hold on humanity. The
healing ministry of Jesus reveals the gradual wresting from Satan of control
over humanity and the establishment of God's kingdom.
8
 [18-21] Two parables are used to
illustrate the future proportions of the kingdom of God that will result from
its deceptively small beginning in the preaching and healing ministry of Jesus.
They are paralleled in 
⇒
 Matthew 13:31-33 and
⇒
 Mark 4:30-32.
9
 [22-30] These sayings of Jesus
follow in Luke upon the parables of the kingdom (
⇒
13:18-21) and stress that great effort is re quired for entrance into
the kingdom (
⇒
 Luke 13:24) and that there is an
urgency to accept the present opportunity to enter because the narrow door will
not remain open indefinitely (
⇒
 Luke 13:25). Lying
behind the sayings is the rejection of Jesus and his message by his Jewish
contemporaries (
⇒
 Luke 13:26) whose places at table
in the kingdom will be taken by Gentiles from the four corners of the world
(
⇒
 Luke 13:29). Those called last (the Gentiles)
will precede those to whom the invitation to enter was first extended (the
Jews). See also 
⇒
 Luke 14:15-24.
10
 [32] Nothing, not even Herod's
desire to kill Jesus, stands in the way of Jesus' role in fulfilling God's will
and in establishing the kingdom through his exorcisms and healings.
11
 [33] It is impossible that a
prophet should die outside of Jerusalem: Jerusalem is the city of destiny and
the goal of the journey of the prophet Jesus. Only when he reaches the holy
city will his work be accomplished.
