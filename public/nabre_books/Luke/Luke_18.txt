[1]
 Then he told them a parable about the
necessity for them to pray always without becoming weary. He said, 
2
"There was a judge in a certain town who
neither feared God nor respected any human being. 
3
And a widow in that town used to come to him
and say, 'Render a just decision for me against my adversary.' 
4
For a long time the judge was unwilling, but
eventually he thought, 'While it is true that I neither fear God nor respect
any human being, 
5
[2]
 because this widow keeps bothering me I shall
deliver a just decision for her lest she finally come and strike me.'" 
6
The Lord said, "Pay attention to what the
dishonest judge says. 
7
Will not God then secure the rights of his
chosen ones who call out to him day and night? Will he be slow to answer them? 
8
I tell you, he will see to it that justice is
done for them speedily. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on
earth?" 
9
He then addressed this parable to those who
were convinced of their own righteousness and despised everyone else. 
10
"Two people went up to the temple area to
pray; one was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector. 
11
The Pharisee took up his position and spoke
this prayer to himself, 'O God, I thank you that I am not like the rest of
humanity - greedy, dishonest, adulterous - or even like this tax collector. 
12
I fast twice a week, and I pay tithes on my
whole income.' 
13
But the tax collector stood off at a distance
and would not even raise his eyes to heaven but beat his breast and prayed, 'O
God, be merciful to me a sinner.' 
14
I tell you, the latter went home justified, not
the former; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who
humbles himself will be exalted." 
15
[3]
[4]
 People were bringing even
infants to him that he might touch them, and when the disciples saw this, they
rebuked them. 
16
Jesus, however, called the children to himself
and said, "Let the children come to me and do not prevent them; for the
kingdom of God belongs to such as these. 
17
Amen, I say to you, whoever does not accept the
kingdom of God like a child will not enter it." 
18
An official asked him this question, "Good
teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" 
19
Jesus answered him, "Why do you call me
good? No one is good but God alone. 
20
You know the commandments, 'You shall not
commit adultery; you shall not kill; you shall not steal; you shall not bear
false witness; honor your father and your mother.'" 
21
And he replied, "All of these I have
observed from my youth." 
22
[5]
 When Jesus heard this he said to him,
"There is still one thing left for you: sell all that you have and
distribute it to the poor, and you will have a treasure in heaven. Then come,
follow me." 
23
But when he heard this he became quite sad, for
he was very rich. 
24
Jesus looked at him (now sad) and said,
"How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! 
25
For it is easier for a camel to pass through
the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God." 
26
Those who heard this said, "Then who can
be saved?" 
27
And he said, "What is impossible for human
beings is possible for God." 
28
Then Peter said, "We have given up our
possessions and followed you." 
29
He said to them, "Amen, I say to you,
there is no one who has given up house or wife or brothers or parents or
children for the sake of the kingdom of God 
30
who will not receive (back) an overabundant
return in this present age and eternal life in the age to come." 
31
[6]
[7]
 Then he took the Twelve
aside and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem and
everything written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled. 
32
He will be handed over to the Gentiles and he
will be mocked and insulted and spat upon; 
33
and after they have scourged him they will kill
him, but on the third day he will rise." 
34
But they understood nothing of this; the word
remained hidden from them and they failed to comprehend what he said. 
35
Now as he approached Jericho a blind man was
sitting by the roadside begging, 
36
and hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what
was happening. 
37
They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is
passing by." 
38
He shouted, "Jesus, Son of David, 
[8]
have pity on me!" 
39
The people walking in front rebuked him,
telling him to be silent, but he kept calling out all the more, "Son of
David, have pity on me!" 
40
Then Jesus stopped and ordered that he be
brought to him; and when he came near, Jesus asked him, 
41
"What do you want me to do for you?"
He replied, "Lord, please let me see." 
42
Jesus told him, "Have sight; your faith
has saved you." 
43
He immediately received his sight and followed
him, giving glory to God. When they saw this, all the people gave praise to
God.

 [1-14] The particularly Lucan
material in the travel narrative concludes with two parables on prayer. The
first (
⇒
 Luke 18:1-8) teaches the disciples the need
of persistent prayer so that they not fall victims to apostasy
(
⇒
 Luke 18:8). The second (
⇒
18:9-14) condemns the self-righteous, critical attitude of the
Pharisee and teaches that the fundamental attitude of the Christian disciple
must be the recognition of sinfulness and complete dependence on God's
graciousness. The second parable recalls the story of the pardoning of the
sinful woman (
⇒
 Luke 7:36-50) where a similar
contrast is presented between the critical attitude of the Pharisee Simon and
the love shown by the pardoned sinner. 
2
 [5] Strike me: the Greek verb
translated as strike means "to strike under the eye" and suggests the
extreme situation to which the persistence of the widow might lead. It may,
however, be used here in the much weaker sense of "to wear one out."
3
[
⇒
 18:15-
⇒
 19:27] Luke
here includes much of the material about the journey to Jerusalem found in his
Marcan source (
⇒
 Luke 10:1-52) and adds to it the
story of Zacchaeus (
⇒
 Luke 19:1-10) from his own
particular tradition and the parable of the gold coins (minas) (
⇒
19:11-27) from Q, the source common to Luke and Matthew.
4
 [15-17] The sayings on children
furnish a contrast to the attitude of the Pharisee in the preceding episode
(
⇒
 Luke 18:9-14) and that of the wealthy official in
the following one (
⇒
 Luke 18:18-23) who think that
they can lay claim to God's favor by their own merit. The attitude of the
disciple should be marked by the receptivity and trustful dependence
characteristic of the child.
5
 [22] Detachment from material
possessions results in the total dependence on God demanded of one who would
inherit eternal life. Sell all that you have: the original saying (cf
⇒
 Mark 10:21) has characteristically been made more
demanding by Luke's addition of "all."
6
 [31-33] The details included in
this third announcement of Jesus' suffering and death suggest that the literary
formulation of the announcement has been directed by the knowledge of the
historical passion and death of Jesus.
7
 [31] Everything written by the
prophets . . . will be fulfilled: this is a Lucan addition to the words of
Jesus found in the Marcan source (
⇒
 Mark 10:32-34).
Luke understands the events of Jesus' last days in Jerusalem to be the
fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, but, as is usually the case in
Luke-Acts, the author does not specify which Old Testament prophets he has in
mind; cf 
⇒
 Luke 24:25,
⇒
 27, 
⇒
 44;
⇒
 Acts 3:8; 
⇒
 13:27;
⇒
 26:22-23.

 [38] Son of David: the blind beggar
identifies Jesus with a title that is related to Jesus' role as Messiah (see
the note on 
⇒
 Luke 2:11). Through this Son of David,
salvation comes to the blind man. Note the connection between salvation and
house of David mentioned earlier in Zechariah's canticle
(
⇒
 Luke 1:69). See also the note on
⇒
 Matthew 9:27.
