[1]
 After this the Lord appointed seventy (-two) 
[2]
others whom he sent ahead of him in pairs to every town and place he intended
to visit. 
2
He said to them, "The harvest is abundant
but the laborers are few; so ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers
for his harvest. 
3
Go on your way; behold, I am sending you like
lambs among wolves. 
4
[3]
 Carry no money bag, no sack, no sandals; and
greet no one along the way. 
5
Into whatever house you enter, first say,
'Peace to this household.' 
[4]
6
If a peaceful person 
[5]
 lives
there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you. 
7
Stay in the same house and eat and drink what
is offered to you, for the laborer deserves his payment. Do not move about from
one house to another. 
8
Whatever town you enter and they welcome you,
eat what is set before you, 
9
cure the sick in it and say to them, 'The kingdom
of God is at hand for you.' 
10
Whatever town you enter and they do not receive
you, go out into the streets and say, 
11
'The dust of your town that clings to our feet,
even that we shake off against you.' Yet know this: the kingdom of God is at
hand. 
12
I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom
on that day than for that town. 
13
[6]
 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you,
Bethsaida! For if the mighty deeds done in your midst had been done in Tyre and
Sidon, they would long ago have repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 
14
But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and
Sidon at the judgment than for you. 
15
[7]
 And as for you, Capernaum, 'Will you be
exalted to heaven? You will go down to the netherworld.'" 
16
Whoever listens to you listens to me. Whoever
rejects you rejects me. And whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent
me." 
17
The seventy (-two) returned rejoicing, and
said, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us because of your name."
18
Jesus said, "I have observed Satan fall
like lightning 
[8]
 from the sky. 
19
Behold, I have given you the power 'to tread
upon serpents' and scorpions and upon the full force of the enemy and nothing
will harm you. 
20
Nevertheless, do not rejoice because the
spirits are subject to you, but rejoice because your names are written in
heaven." 
21
At that very moment he rejoiced (in) the holy
Spirit and said, "I give you praise, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for
although you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned you have
revealed them to the childlike. 
[9]
 Yes, Father, such has been
your gracious will. 
22
All things have been handed over to me by my
Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is
except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him." 
23
Turning to the disciples in private he said,
"Blessed are the eyes that see what you see. 
24
For I say to you, many prophets and kings desired
to see what you see, but did not see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not
hear it." 
25
[10]
 There was a scholar of the law 
[11]
who stood up to test him and said, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit
eternal life?" 
26
Jesus said to him, "What is written in the
law? How do you read it?" 
27
He said in reply, "You shall love the
Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your being, with all your
strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself." 
28
He replied to him, "You have answered
correctly; do this and you will live." 
29
But because he wished to justify himself, he
said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?" 
30
Jesus replied, "A man fell victim to
robbers as he went down from Jerusalem to Jericho. They stripped and beat him
and went off leaving him half-dead. 
31
[12]
 A priest happened to be going down that road,
but when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side. 
32
Likewise a Levite came to the place, and when
he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side. 
33
But a Samaritan traveler who came upon him was
moved with compassion at the sight. 
34
He approached the victim, poured oil and wine
over his wounds and bandaged them. Then he lifted him up on his own animal,
took him to an inn and cared for him. 
35
The next day he took out two silver coins and
gave them to the innkeeper with the instruction, 'Take care of him. If you
spend more than what I have given you, I shall repay you on my way back.' 
36
Which of these three, in your opinion, was
neighbor to the robbers' victim?" 
37
He answered, "The one who treated him with
mercy." Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise." 
38
[13]
 As they continued their journey he entered a
village where a woman whose name was Martha welcomed him. 
39
[14]
 She had a sister named Mary (who) sat beside
the Lord at his feet listening to him speak. 
40
Martha, burdened with much serving, came to him
and said, "Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me by myself to
do the serving? Tell her to help me." 
41
The Lord said to her in reply, "Martha,
Martha, you are anxious and worried about many things. 
42
[15]
 There is need of only one thing. Mary has
chosen the better part and it will not be taken from her." 
1
 [1-12] Only the Gospel of Luke
contains two episodes in which Jesus sends out his followers on a mission: the
first (
⇒
 Luke 10:1-6) is based on the mission in
⇒
 Mark 6:6b-13 and recounts the sending out of the
Twelve; here in 
⇒
 Luke 10:1-12 a similar report
based on Q becomes the sending out of seventy-two in this gospel. The episode
continues the theme of Jesus preparing witnesses to himself and his ministry.
These witnesses include not only the Twelve but also the seventy-two who may
represent the Christian mission in Luke's own day. Note that the instructions
given to the Twelve and to the seventy-two are similar and that what is said to
the seventy-two in 
⇒
 Luke 10:4 is directed to the
Twelve in 
⇒
 Luke 22:35.
2
 [1] Seventy[-two]: important
representatives of the Alexandrian and Caesarean text types read
"seventy," while other important Alexandrian texts and Western
readings have "seventy-two." 
3
 [4] Carry no money bag . . . greet
no one along the way: because of the urgency of the mission and the
singlemindedness required of missionaries, attachment to material possessions
should be avoided and even customary greetings should not distract from the
fulfillment of the task.
4
 [5] First say, "Peace to this
household': see the notes on 
⇒
 Luke 2:14 and
⇒
 Matthew 10:13.
5
 [6] A peaceful person: literally,
"a son of peace."
6
 [13-16] The call to repentance that
is a part of the proclamation of the kingdom brings with it a severe judgment
for those who hear it and reject it.
7
 [15] The netherworld: the
underworld, the place of the dead (
⇒
 Acts 2:27, 
⇒
 31)
here contrasted with heaven; see also the note on 
⇒
 Matthew
11:23.
8
 [18] I have observed Satan fall
like lightning: the effect of the mission of the seventy-two is characterized
by the Lucan Jesus as a symbolic fall of Satan. As the kingdom of God is
gradually being established, evil in all its forms is being defeated; the
dominion of Satan over humanity is at an end.
9
 [21] Revealed them to the
childlike: a restatement of the theme announced in 
⇒
8:10: the mysteries of the kingdom are revealed to the disciples. See
also the note on 
⇒
 Matthew 11:25-27.
10
 [25-37] In response to a question from
a Jewish legal expert about inheriting eternal life, Jesus illustrates the
superiority of love over legalism through the story of the good Samaritan. The
law of love proclaimed in the "Sermon on the Plain"
(
⇒
 Luke 6:27-36) is exemplified by one whom the
legal expert would have considered ritually impure (see 
⇒
 John
4:9). Moreover, the identity of the "neighbor" requested by
the legal expert (
⇒
 Luke 10:29) turns out to be a
Samaritan, the enemy of the Jew (see the note on 
⇒
9:52).
11
 [25] Scholar of the law: an expert
in the Mosaic law, and probably a member of the group elsewhere identified as
the scribes (
⇒
 Luke 5:21).
12
 [31-32] Priest . . . Levite: those religious
representatives of Judaism who would have been expected to be models of
"neighbor" to the victim pass him by.
13
 [38-42] The story of Martha and
Mary further illustrates the importance of hearing the words of the teacher and
the concern with women in Luke.
14
 [39] Sat beside the Lord at his
feet: it is remarkable for first-century Palestinian Judaism that a woman would
assume the posture of a disciple at the master's feet (see also
⇒
 Luke 8:35; 
⇒
 Acts
22:3), and it reveals a characteristic attitude of Jesus toward women
in this gospel (see 
⇒
 Luke 8:2-3).
15
 [42] There is need of only one
thing: some ancient versions read, "there is need of few things";
another important, although probably inferior, reading found in some
manuscripts is, "there is need of few things, or of one."
