1
[1]
 He summoned the Twelve and gave them power and
authority over all demons and to cure diseases, 
2
and he sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God
and to heal (the sick). 
3
He said to them, "Take nothing for the
journey, 
[2]
 neither walking stick, nor sack, nor food, nor
money, and let no one take a second tunic. 
4
Whatever house you enter, stay there and leave
from there. 
5
And as for those who do not welcome you, when
you leave that town, shake the dust from your feet 
[3]
 in
testimony against them." 
6
Then they set out and went from village to
village proclaiming the good news and curing diseases everywhere. 
7
[4]
 Herod the tetrarch 
[5]
 heard
about all that was happening, and he was greatly perplexed because some were
saying, "John has been raised from the dead"; 
8
others were saying, "Elijah has
appeared"; still others, "One of the ancient prophets has
arisen." 
9
[6]
 But Herod said, "John I beheaded. Who
then is this about whom I hear such things?" And he kept trying to see
him. 
10
When the apostles returned, they explained to
him what they had done. He took them and withdrew in private to a town called
Bethsaida. 
11
The crowds, meanwhile, learned of this and
followed him. He received them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and
he healed those who needed to be cured. 
12
As the day was drawing to a close, the Twelve
approached him and said, "Dismiss the crowd so that they can go to the
surrounding villages and farms and find lodging and provisions; for we are in a
deserted place here." 
13
He said to them, "Give them some food
yourselves." They replied, "Five loaves and two fish are all we have,
unless we ourselves go and buy food for all these people." 
14
Now the men there numbered about five thousand.
Then he said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of (about)
fifty." 
15
They did so and made them all sit down. 
16
Then taking 
[7]
 the five
loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he said the blessing over
them, broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd. 
17
They all ate and were satisfied. And when the leftover
fragments were picked up, they filled twelve wicker baskets. 
18
[8]
[9]
 Once when Jesus was
praying in solitude, and the disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who
do the crowds say that I am?" 
19
They said in reply, "John the Baptist;
others, Elijah; still others, 'One of the ancient prophets has arisen.'" 
20
Then he said to them, "But who do you say
that I am?" Peter said in reply, "The Messiah of God." 
[10]
21
He rebuked them and directed them not to tell
this to anyone. 
22
He said, "The Son of Man must suffer
greatly and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and
be killed and on the third day be raised." 
23
Then he said to all, "If anyone wishes to
come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily 
[11]
and follow me. 
24
For whoever wishes to save his life will lose
it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. 
25
What profit is there for one to gain the whole
world yet lose or forfeit himself? 
26
Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, the
Son of Man will be ashamed of when he comes in his glory and in the glory of
the Father and of the holy angels. 
27
Truly I say to you, there are some standing
here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God." 
28
[12]
[13]
 About eight days after
he said this, he took Peter, John, and James and went up the mountain to pray. 
29
While he was praying his face changed in
appearance and his clothing became dazzling white. 
30
And behold, two men were conversing with him,
Moses and Elijah, 
[14]
31
[15]
 who appeared in glory and spoke of his exodus
that he was going to accomplish in Jerusalem. 
32
Peter and his companions had been overcome by sleep,
but becoming fully awake, they saw his glory 
[16]
 and the two
men standing with him. 
33
As they were about to part from him, Peter said
to Jesus, "Master, it is good that we are here; let us make three tents, 
[17]
one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." But he did not know what
he was saying. 
34
[18]
 While he was still speaking, a cloud came and
cast a shadow over them, and they became frightened when they entered the
cloud. 
35
[19]
 Then from the cloud came a voice that said,
"This is my chosen Son; listen to him." 
36
After the voice had spoken, Jesus was found
alone. They fell silent and did not at that time 
[20]
 tell
anyone what they had seen. 
37
[21]
 On the next day, when they came down from the
mountain, a large crowd met him. 
38
There was a man in the crowd who cried out,
"Teacher, I beg you, look at my son; he is my only child. 
39
For a spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams
and it convulses him until he foams at the mouth; it releases him only with
difficulty, wearing him out. 
40
I begged your disciples to cast it out but they
could not." 
41
Jesus said in reply, "O faithless and
perverse generation, how long will I be with you and endure you? Bring your son
here." 
42
As he was coming forward, the demon threw him
to the ground in a convulsion; but Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the
boy, and returned him to his father. 
43
And all were astonished by the majesty of God.
While they were all amazed at his every deed, he said to his disciples, 
44
"Pay attention to what I am telling you.
The Son of Man is to be handed over to men." 
45
But they did not understand this saying; its
meaning was hidden from them so that they should not understand it, and they
were afraid to ask him about this saying. 
46
[22]
 An argument arose among the disciples about
which of them was the greatest. 
47
Jesus realized the intention of their hearts
and took a child and placed it by his side 
48
and said to them, "Whoever receives this
child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent
me. For the one who is least among all of you is the one who is the
greatest." 
49
Then John said in reply, "Master, we saw
someone casting out demons in your name and we tried to prevent him because he
does not follow in our company." 
50
Jesus said to him, "Do not prevent him,
for whoever is not against you is for you." 
51
[23]
[24]
[25]
When the days for his being taken up were fulfilled, he resolutely determined
to journey to Jerusalem, 
52
[26]
 and he sent messengers ahead of him. On the
way they entered a Samaritan village to prepare for his reception there, 
53
but they would not welcome him because the
destination of his journey was Jerusalem. 
54
When the disciples James and John saw this they
asked, "Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to consume them?"
55
Jesus turned and rebuked them, 
56
and they journeyed to another village. 
57
[27]
 As they were proceeding on their journey
someone said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go." 
58
Jesus answered him, "Foxes have dens and
birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest his
head." 
59
And to another he said, "Follow me."
But he replied, "(Lord,) let me go first and bury my father." 
60
But he answered him, "Let the dead bury
their dead. 
[28]
 But you, go and proclaim the kingdom of
God." 
61
And another said, "I will follow you,
Lord, but first let me say farewell to my family at home." 
62
(To him) Jesus said, "No one who sets a
hand to the plow and looks to what was left behind is fit for the kingdom of
God." 
1
 [1-6] Armed with the power and
authority that Jesus himself has been displaying in the previous episodes, the
Twelve are now sent out to continue the work that Jesus has been performing
throughout his Galilean ministry: (1) proclaiming the kingdom (
⇒
4:43; 
⇒
 8:1); (2) exorcising demons
(
⇒
 Luke 4:33-37, 
⇒
 41;
⇒
 8:26-39) and (3) healing the sick
(
⇒
 Luke 4:38-40;
⇒
 5:12-16, 
⇒
 17-26;
⇒
 6:6-10; 
⇒
 7:1-10,
⇒
 17, 
⇒
 22;
⇒
 Luke 8:40-56). 
2
 [3] Take nothing for the journey:
the absolute detachment required of the disciple (
⇒
14:33) leads to complete reliance on God (
⇒
12:22-31).
3
 [5] Shake the dust from your feet:
see the note on 
⇒
 Matthew 10:14.
4
 [7-56] This section in which Luke
gathers together incidents that focus on the identity of Jesus is introduced by
a question that Herod is made to ask in this gospel: "Who then is this
about whom I hear such things?" (
⇒
 Luke 9:9) In
subsequent episodes, Luke reveals to the reader various answers to Herod's
question: Jesus is one in whom God's power is present and who provides for the
needs of God's people (
⇒
 Luke 9:10-17); Peter
declares Jesus to be "the Messiah of God" (
⇒
9:18-21); Jesus says he is the suffering Son of Man
(
⇒
 Luke 22:43-45); Jesus is the Master to be
followed, even to death (
⇒
 Luke 9:23-27); Jesus is
God's son, his Chosen One (
⇒
 Luke 9:28-36).
5
 [7] Herod the tetrarch: see the
note on 
⇒
 Luke 3:1.
6
 [9] And he kept trying to see him:
this indication of Herod's interest in Jesus prepares for
⇒
 Luke 13:31-33 and for 
⇒
23:8-12 where Herod's curiosity about Jesus' power to perform
miracles remains unsatisfied.
7
 [16] Then taking . . . : the
actions of Jesus recall the institution of the Eucharist in
⇒
 Luke 22:19; see also the note on
⇒
 Matthew 14:19.
8
 [18-22] This incident is based on
⇒
 Mark 8:27-33, but Luke has eliminated Peter's
refusal to accept Jesus as suffering Son of Man (
⇒
 Mark
8:32) and the rebuke of Peter by Jesus (
⇒
 Mark
8:33). Elsewhere in the gospel, Luke softens the harsh portrait of
Peter and the other apostles found in his Marcan source (cf
⇒
 Luke 22:39-46, which similarly lacks a rebuke of
Peter that occurs in the source, 
⇒
 Mark 14:37-38).
9
 [18] When Jesus was praying in
solitude: see the note on 
⇒
 Luke 3:21.
10
 [20] The Messiah of God: on the meaning
of this title in first-century Palestinian Judaism, see the notes on
⇒
 Luke 2:11 and on 
⇒
 Matthew
16:13-20 and 
⇒
 Mark 8:27-30.
11
 [23] Daily: this is a Lucan
addition to a saying of Jesus, removing the saying from a context that
envisioned the imminent suffering and death of the disciple of Jesus (as does
the saying in 
⇒
 Mark 8:34-35) to one that focuses on
the demands of daily Christian existence.
12
 [28-36] Situated shortly after the
first announcement of the passion, death, and resurrection, this scene of
Jesus' transfiguration provides the heavenly confirmation to Jesus' declaration
that his suffering will end in glory (
⇒
 Luke 9:32);
see also the notes on 
⇒
 Matthew 17:1-8 and
⇒
 Mark 9:2-8.
13
 [28] Up the mountain to pray: the
"mountain" is the regular place of prayer in Luke (see 
⇒
6:12; 
⇒
 22:39-41).
14
 [30] Moses and Elijah: the two
figures represent the Old Testament law and the prophets. At the end of this
episode, the heavenly voice will identify Jesus as the one to be listened to
now (
⇒
 Luke 9:35). See also the note on
⇒
 Mark 9:5.
15
 [31] His exodus that he was going
to accomplish in Jerusalem: Luke identifies the subject of the conversation as
the exodus of Jesus, a reference to the death, resurrection, and ascension of
Jesus that will take place in Jerusalem, the city of destiny (see
⇒
 Luke 9:51). The mention of exodus, however, also
calls to mind the Israelite Exodus from Egypt to the promised land.
16
 [32] They saw his glory: the glory
that is proper to God is here attributed to Jesus (see 
⇒
24:26).
17
 [33] Let us make three tents: in a
possible allusion to the feast of Tabernacles, Peter may be likening his joy on
the occasion of the transfiguration to the joyful celebration of this harvest
festival.
18
 [34] Over them: it is not clear
whether them refers to Jesus, Moses, and Elijah, or to the disciples. For the
cloud casting its shadow, see the note on 
⇒
 Mark 9:7.
19
 [35] Like the heavenly voice that
identified Jesus at his baptism prior to his undertaking the Galilean ministry
(
⇒
 Luke 3:22), so too here before the journey to the
city of destiny is begun (
⇒
 Luke 9:51) the heavenly
voice again identifies Jesus as Son. Listen to him: the two representatives of
Israel of old depart (
⇒
 Luke 9:33) and Jesus is left
alone (
⇒
 Luke 9:36) as the teacher whose words must
be heeded (see also 
⇒
 Acts 3:22).
20
 [36] At that time: i.e., before the
resurrection.
21
 [37-43a] See the note on 
⇒
 Mark
9:14-29.
22
 [46-50] These two incidents focus
on attitudes that are opposed to Christian discipleship: rivalry and
intolerance of outsiders.
23
[
⇒
 9:51-
⇒
 18:14] The
Galilean ministry of Jesus finishes with the previous episode and a new section
of Luke's gospel begins, the journey to Jerusalem. This journey is based on
⇒
 Mark 10:1-52 but Luke uses his Marcan source only
in 
⇒
18:15-
⇒
 19:27. Before that point he has
inserted into his gospel a distinctive collection of sayings of Jesus and
stories about him that he has drawn from Q, a collection of sayings of Jesus used
also by Matthew, and from his own special traditions. All of the material
collected in this section is loosely organized within the framework of a
journey of Jesus to Jerusalem, the city of destiny, where his exodus
(suffering, death, resurrection, ascension) is to take place
(
⇒
 Luke 9:31), where salvation is accomplished, and
from where the proclamation of God's saving word is to go forth
(
⇒
 Luke 24:47; 
⇒
 Acts
1:8). Much of the material in the Lucan travel narrative is teaching
for the disciples. During the course of this journey Jesus is preparing his
chosen Galilean witnesses for the role they will play after his exodus
(
⇒
 Luke 9:31): they are to be his witnesses to the
people (
⇒
 Acts 10:39;
⇒
 13:31) and thereby provide certainty to the
readers of Luke's gospel that the teachings they have received are rooted in
the teachings of Jesus (
⇒
 Luke 1:1-4).
24
 [51-55] Just as the Galilean
ministry began with a rejection of Jesus in his hometown, so too the travel
narrative begins with the rejection of him by Samaritans. In this episode Jesus
disassociates himself from the attitude expressed by his disciples that those
who reject him are to be punished severely. The story alludes to
⇒
 2 Kings 1:10, 
⇒
 12
where the prophet Elijah takes the course of action Jesus rejects, and Jesus
thereby rejects the identification of himself with Elijah.
25
 [51] Days for his being taken up:
like the reference to his exodus in 
⇒
 Luke 9:31 this
is probably a reference to all the events (suffering, death, resurrection,
ascension) of his last days in Jerusalem. He resolutely determined: literally,
"he set his face."
26
 [52] Samaritan: Samaria was the
territory between Judea and Galilee west of the Jordan river. For ethnic and
religious reasons, the Samaritans and the Jews were bitterly opposed to one
another (see 
⇒
 John 4:9).
27
 [57-62] In these sayings Jesus
speaks of the severity and the unconditional nature of Christian discipleship.
Even family ties and filial obligations, such as burying one's parents, cannot
distract one no matter how briefly from proclaiming the kingdom of God. The
first two sayings are paralleled in 
⇒
 Matthew
8:19-22; see also the notes there.
28
 [60] Let the dead bury their dead:
i.e., let the spiritually dead (those who do not follow) bury their physically
dead. See also the note on 
⇒
 Matthew 8:22.
