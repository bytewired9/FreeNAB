[1]
 But at daybreak on the first day of the week they
took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. 
2
They found the stone rolled away from the tomb;
3
but when they entered, they did not find the
body of the Lord Jesus. 
4
While they were puzzling over this, behold, two
men in dazzling garments appeared to them. 
5
They were terrified and bowed their faces to
the ground. They said to them, "Why do you seek the living one among the
dead? 
6
He is not here, but he has been raised. 
[2]
Remember what he said to you while he was still in Galilee, 
7
that the Son of Man must be handed over to
sinners and be crucified, and rise on the third day." 
8
And they remembered his words. 
9
[3]
 Then they returned from the tomb and announced
all these things to the eleven and to all the others. 
10
The women were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary
the mother of James; the others who accompanied them also told this to the
apostles, 
11
but their story seemed like nonsense and they
did not believe them. 
12
[4]
 But Peter got up and ran to the tomb, bent down,
and saw the burial cloths alone; then he went home amazed at what had happened.
13
[5]
[6]
 Now that very day two of
them were going to a village seven miles from Jerusalem called Emmaus, 
14
and they were conversing about all the things
that had occurred. 
15
And it happened that while they were conversing
and debating, Jesus himself drew near and walked with them, 
16
[7]
 but their eyes were prevented from recognizing
him. 
17
He asked them, "What are you discussing as
you walk along?" They stopped, looking downcast. 
18
One of them, named Cleopas, said to him in
reply, "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know of the
things that have taken place there in these days?" 
19
And he replied to them, "What sort of
things?" They said to him, "The things that happened to Jesus the
Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the
people, 
20
how our chief priests and rulers both handed
him over to a sentence of death and crucified him. 
21
But we were hoping that he would be the one to
redeem Israel; and besides all this, it is now the third day since this took
place. 
22
Some women from our group, however, have
astounded us: they were at the tomb early in the morning 
23
and did not find his body; they came back and
reported that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who announced that he was
alive. 
24
Then some of those with us went to the tomb and
found things just as the women had described, but him they did not see." 
25
And he said to them, "Oh, how foolish you are!
How slow of heart to believe all that the prophets spoke! 
26
Was it not necessary that the Messiah should
suffer 
[8]
 these things and enter into his glory?" 
27
Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets,
he interpreted to them what referred to him in all the scriptures. 
28
As they approached the village to which they
were going, he gave the impression that he was going on farther. 
29
But they urged him, "Stay with us, for it
is nearly evening and the day is almost over." So he went in to stay with
them. 
30
And it happened that, while he was with them at
table, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them. 
31
With that their eyes were opened and they
recognized him, but he vanished from their sight. 
32
Then they said to each other, "Were not
our hearts burning (within us) while he spoke to us on the way and opened the
scriptures to us?" 
33
So they set out at once and returned to
Jerusalem where they found gathered together the eleven and those with them 
34
who were saying, "The Lord has truly been
raised and has appeared to Simon!" 
35
Then the two recounted what had taken place on
the way and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread. 
36
[9]
 While they were still speaking about this, he
stood in their midst and said to them, "Peace be with you." 
37
But they were startled and terrified and
thought that they were seeing a ghost. 
38
Then he said to them, "Why are you
troubled? And why do questions arise in your hearts? 
39
[10]
 Look at my hands and my feet, that it is I
myself. Touch me and see, because a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you
can see I have." 
40
And as he said this, he showed them his hands
and his feet. 
41
While they were still incredulous for joy and
were amazed, he asked them, "Have you anything here to eat?" 
42
They gave him a piece of baked fish; 
43
he took it and ate it in front of them. 
44
He said to them, "These are my words that
I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in
the law of Moses and in the prophets and psalms must be fulfilled." 
45
Then he opened their minds to understand the
scriptures. 
46
[11]
 And he said to them, "Thus it is written
that the Messiah would suffer and rise from the dead on the third day 
47
and that repentance, for the forgiveness of
sins, would be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning from
Jerusalem. 
48
You are witnesses of these things. 
49
And (behold) I am sending the promise of my
Father 
[12]
 upon you; but stay in the city until you are
clothed with power from on high." 
50
[13]
 Then he led them (out) as far as Bethany,
raised his hands, and blessed them. 
51
As he blessed them he parted from them and was
taken up to heaven. 
52
They did him homage and then returned to Jerusalem
with great joy, 
53
and they were continually in the temple
praising God.

1
 [1-53] The resurrection narrative
in Luke consists of five sec tions: (1) the women at the empty tomb
(
⇒
23:56b-
⇒
 24:12); (2) the appearance to
the two disciples on the way to Emmaus (
⇒
24:13-35); (3) the appearance to the disciples in Jerusalem
(
⇒
 Luke 24:36-43); (4) Jesus' final instructions
(
⇒
 Luke 24:44-49); (5) the ascension
(
⇒
 Luke 24:50-53). In Luke, all the resurrection
appearances take place in and around Jerusalem; moreover, they are all
recounted as having taken place on Easter Sunday. A consistent theme throughout
the narrative is that the suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus were
accomplished in fulfillment of Old Testament promises and of Jewish hopes
(
⇒
 Luke 24:19a, 
⇒
 21,
⇒
 26-27, 
⇒
 44,
⇒
 46). In his second volume, Acts, Luke will argue
that Christianity is the fulfillment of the hopes of Pharisaic Judaism and its
logical development (see 
⇒
 Acts 24:10-21). 
2
 [6] He is not here, but he has been
raised: this part of the verse is omitted in important representatives of the
Western text tradition, but its presence in other text types and the slight
difference in wording from 
⇒
 Matthew 28:6 and
⇒
 Mark 16:6 argue for its retention.
3
 [9] The women in this gospel do not
flee from the tomb and tell no one, as in 
⇒
 Mark
16:8 but return and tell the disciples about their experience. The
initial reaction to the testimony of the women is disbelief (
⇒
24:11).
4
 [12] This verse is missing from the
Western textual tradition but is found in the best and oldest manuscripts of
other text types.
5
 [13-35] This episode focuses on the
interpretation of scripture by the risen Jesus and the recognition of him in
the breaking of the bread. The references to the quotations of scripture and
explanation of it (
⇒
 Luke 24:25-27), the kerygmatic
proclamation (
⇒
 Luke 24:34), and the liturgical
gesture (
⇒
 Luke 24:30) suggest that the episode is
primarily catechetical and liturgical rather than apologetic.
6
 [13] Seven miles: literally,
"sixty stades." A stade was 607 feet. Some manuscripts read "160
stades" or more than eighteen miles. The exact location of Emmaus is
disputed.
7
 [16] A consistent feature of the
resurrection stories is that the risen Jesus was different and initially
unrecognizable (
⇒
 Luke 24:37;
⇒
 Mark 16:12; 
⇒
 John
20:14; 
⇒
 21:4).
8
 [26] That the Messiah should suffer
. . . : Luke is the only New Testament writer to speak explicitly of a
suffering Messiah (
⇒
 Luke 24:26,
⇒
 46; 
⇒
 Acts 3:18;
⇒
 17:3; 
⇒
 26:23). The
idea of a suffering Messiah is not found in the Old Testament or in other
Jewish literature prior to the New Testament period, although the idea is
hinted at in 
⇒
 Mark 8:31-33. See the notes on
⇒
 Matthew 26:63 and 
⇒
 26:67-68.
9
 [36-43,44-49] The Gospel of Luke,
like each of the other gospels (
⇒
 Matthew 28:16-20;
⇒
 Mark 16:14-15; 
⇒
 John
20:19-23), focuses on an important appearance of Jesus to the Twelve
in which they are commissioned for their future ministry. As in
⇒
 Luke 24:6, 
⇒
 12, so in
⇒
 Luke 24:36, 
⇒
 40
there are omissions in the Western text.
10
 [39-42] The apologetic purpose of
this story is evident in the concern with the physical details and the report
that Jesus ate food.
11
 [46] See the note on
⇒
 Luke 24:26.
12
 [49] The promise of my Father:
i.e., the gift of the holy Spirit.
13
 [50-53] Luke brings his story about
the time of Jesus to a close with the report of the ascension. He will also
begin the story of the time of the church with a recounting of the ascension.
In the gospel, Luke recounts the ascension of Jesus on Easter Sunday night,
thereby closely associating it with the resurrection. In 
⇒
 Acts
1:3, 
⇒
 9-11; 
⇒
 13:31
he historicizes the ascension by speaking of a forty-day period between the
resurrection and the ascension. The Western text omits some phrases in
⇒
 Luke 24:51, 
⇒
 52
perhaps to avoid any chronological conflict with Acts 1 about the time of the
ascension.
14
 [53] The Gospel of Luke ends as it
began (
⇒
 Luke 1:9), in the Jerusalem temple.
