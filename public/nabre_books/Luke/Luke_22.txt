[1]
 Now the feast of Unleavened Bread, called the
Passover, 
[2]
 was drawing near, 
2
and the chief priests and the scribes were
seeking a way to put him to death, for they were afraid of the people. 
3
Then Satan entered into Judas, 
[3]
the one surnamed Iscariot, who was counted among the Twelve, 
4
and he went to the chief priests and temple
guards to discuss a plan for handing him over to them. 
5
They were pleased and agreed to pay him money. 
6
He accepted their offer and sought a favorable
opportunity to hand him over to them in the absence of a crowd. 
7
When the day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread
arrived, the day for sacrificing the Passover lamb, 
8
he sent out Peter and John, instructing them,
"Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover." 
9
They asked him, "Where do you want us to
make the preparations?" 
10
And he answered them, "When you go into
the city, a man will meet you carrying a jar of water. 
[4]
Follow him into the house that he enters 
11
and say to the master of the house, 'The
teacher says to you, "Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover
with my disciples?"' 
12
He will show you a large upper room that is
furnished. Make the preparations there." 
13
Then they went off and found everything exactly
as he had told them, and there they prepared the Passover. 
14
When the hour came, he took his place at table
with the apostles. 
15
He said to them, "I have eagerly desired
to eat this Passover 
[5]
 with you before I suffer, 
16
for, I tell you, I shall not eat it (again)
until there is fulfillment in the kingdom of God." 
17
Then he took a cup, 
[6]
 gave
thanks, and said, "Take this and share it among yourselves; 
18
for I tell you (that) from this time on I shall
not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes." 
19
[7]
 Then he took the bread, said the blessing,
broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body, which will be
given for you; do this in memory of me." 
20
And likewise the cup after they had eaten,
saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which will be shed for
you. 
21
"And yet behold, the hand of the one who
is to betray me is with me on the table; 
22
for the Son of Man indeed goes as it has been
determined; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed." 
23
And they began to debate among themselves who
among them would do such a deed. 
24
[8]
 Then an argument broke out among them about
which of them should be regarded as the greatest. 
25
[9]
 He said to them, "The kings of the
Gentiles lord it over them and those in authority over them are addressed as
'Benefactors'; 
26
but among you it shall not be so. Rather, let
the greatest among you be as the youngest, and the leader as the servant. 
27
For who is greater: the one seated at table or
the one who serves? Is it not the one seated at table? I am among you as the
one who serves. 
28
It is you who have stood by me in my trials; 
29
and I confer a kingdom on you, just as my
Father has conferred one on me, 
30
that you may eat and drink at my table in my
kingdom; and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
31
[10]
[11]
 "Simon, Simon,
behold Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat, 
32
but I have prayed that your own faith may not
fail; and once you have turned back, you must strengthen your brothers." 
33
He said to him, "Lord, I am prepared to go
to prison and to die with you." 
34
But he replied, "I tell you, Peter, before
the cock crows this day, you will deny three times that you know me." 
35
He said to them, "When I sent you forth
without a money bag or a sack or sandals, were you in need of anything?"
"No, nothing," they replied. 
36
He said to them, 
[12]
"But now one who has a money bag should take it, and likewise a sack, and
one who does not have a sword should sell his cloak and buy one. 
37
For I tell you that this scripture must be
fulfilled in me, namely, 'He was counted among the wicked'; and indeed what is
written about me is coming to fulfillment." 
38
Then they said, "Lord, look, there are two
swords here." But he replied, "It is enough!" 
[13]
39
Then going out he went, as was his custom, to
the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him. 
40
When he arrived at the place he said to them,
"Pray that you may not undergo the test." 
41
After withdrawing about a stone's throw from
them and kneeling, he prayed, 
42
saying, "Father, if you are willing, take
this cup away from me; still, not my will but yours be done." 
43
[14]
 (And to strengthen him an angel from heaven
appeared to him. 
44
He was in such agony and he prayed so fervently
that his sweat became like drops of blood falling on the ground.) 
45
When he rose from prayer and returned to his
disciples, he found them sleeping from grief. 
46
He said to them, "Why are you sleeping?
Get up and pray that you may not undergo the test." 
47
While he was still speaking, a crowd approached
and in front was one of the Twelve, a man named Judas. He went up to Jesus to
kiss him. 
48
Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying
the Son of Man with a kiss?" 
49
His disciples realized what was about to
happen, and they asked, "Lord, shall we strike with a sword?" 
50
And one of them struck the high priest's
servant and cut off his right ear. 
51
[15]
 But Jesus said in reply, "Stop, no more
of this!" Then he touched the servant's ear and healed him. 
52
And Jesus said to the chief priests and temple
guards and elders who had come for him, "Have you come out as against a
robber, with swords and clubs? 
53
Day after day I was with you in the temple
area, and you did not seize me; but this is your hour, the time for the power
of darkness." 
54
After arresting him they led him away and took
him into the house of the high priest; Peter was following at a distance. 
55
They lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard
and sat around it, and Peter sat down with them. 
56
When a maid saw him seated in the light, she
looked intently at him and said, "This man too was with him." 
57
But he denied it saying, "Woman, I do not
know him." 
58
A short while later someone else saw him and
said, "You too are one of them"; but Peter answered, "My friend,
I am not." 
59
About an hour later, still another insisted,
"Assuredly, this man too was with him, for he also is a Galilean." 
60
But Peter said, "My friend, I do not know
what you are talking about." Just as he was saying this, the cock crowed, 
61
and the Lord turned and looked at Peter; 
[16]
and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, "Before
the cock crows today, you will deny me three times." 
62
He went out and began to weep bitterly. 
63
The men who held Jesus in custody were
ridiculing and beating him. 
64
They blindfolded him and questioned him,
saying, "Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?" 
65
And they reviled him in saying many other
things against him. 
66
[17]
[18]
 When day came the
council of elders of the people met, both chief priests and scribes, and they
brought him before their Sanhedrin. 
67
They said, "If you are the Messiah, tell
us," but he replied to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe, 
68
and if I question, you will not respond. 
69
But from this time on the Son of Man will be
seated at the right hand of the power of God." 
70
They all asked, "Are you then the Son of
God?" He replied to them, "You say that I am." 
71
Then they said, "What further need have we
for testimony? We have heard it from his own mouth."

 23:56a] The
passion narrative. Luke is still dependent upon Mark for the composition of the
passion narrative but has incorporated much of his own special tradition into
the narrative. Among the distinctive sections in Luke are: (1) the tradition of
the institution of the Eucharist (
⇒
 Luke 22:15-20);
(2) Jesus' farewell discourse (
⇒
 Luke 22:21-38);
(3) the mistreatment and interrogation of Jesus (
⇒
22:63-71); (4) Jesus before Herod and his second appearance before
Pilate (
⇒
 Luke 23:6-16); (5) words addressed to the
women followers on the way to the crucifixion (
⇒
23:27-32); (6) words to the penitent thief (
⇒
23:39-41); (7) the death of Jesus (
⇒
23:46, 
⇒
 47b-49). Luke stresses the
innocence of Jesus (
⇒
 Luke 23:4,
⇒
 14-15, 
⇒
 22) who is
the victim of the powers of evil (
⇒
 Luke 22:3,
⇒
 31, 
⇒
 53) and who
goes to his death in fulfillment of his Father's will (
⇒
22:42, 
⇒
 46). Throughout the narrative
Luke emphasizes the mercy, compassion, and healing power of Jesus
(
⇒
 Luke 22:51; 
⇒
 23:43)
who does not go to death lonely and deserted, but is accompanied by others who
follow him on the way of the cross (
⇒
23:26-31, 
⇒
 49).

 [15] This Passover: Luke clearly
identifies this last supper of Jesus with the apostles as a Passover meal that
commemorated the deliverance of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. Jesus
reinterprets the significance of the Passover by setting it in the context of
the kingdom of God (
⇒
 Luke 22:16). The
"deliverance" associated with the Passover finds its new meaning in
the blood that will be shed (
⇒
 Luke 22:20).
6
 [17] Because of a textual problem
in 
⇒
 Luke 22:19-20 some commentators interpret this
cup as the eucharistic cup.
7
 [19c-20] Which will be given . . .
do this in memory of me: these words are omitted in some important Western text
manuscripts and a few Syriac manuscripts. Other ancient text types, including
the oldest papyrus manuscript of Luke dating from the late second or early
third century, contain the longer reading presented here. The Lucan account of
the words of institution of the Eucharist bears a close resemblance to the
words of institution in the Pauline tradition (see 
⇒
 1 Cor
11:23-26). See also the notes on 
⇒
 Matthew
26:26-29;

 26:27-28; and
⇒
 Mark 14:22-24.

 [24-38] The Gospel of Luke presents
a brief farewell discourse of Jesus; compare the lengthy farewell discourses
and prayer in John 13-17.
9
 [25] 'Benefactors': this word
occurs as a title of rulers in the Hellenistic world.
10
 [31-32] Jesus' prayer for Simon's
faith and the commission to strengthen his brothers anticipates the
post-resurrectional prominence of Peter in the first half of Acts, where he
appears as the spokesman for the Christian community and the one who begins the
mission to the Gentiles (Acts 10-11).
11
 [31] All of you: literally, "you."
The translation reflects the meaning of the Greek text that uses a second
person plural pronoun here.
12
 [36] In contrast to the ministry of
the Twelve and of the seventy-two during the period of Jesus
(
⇒
 Luke 9:3; 
⇒
 10:4), in
the future period of the church the missionaries must be prepared for the
opposition they will face in a world hostile to their preaching.
13
 [38] It is enough!: the farewell
discourse ends abruptly with these words of Jesus spoken to the disciples when
they take literally what was intended as figurative language about being
prepared to face the world's hostility.
14
 [43-44] These verses, though very
ancient, were probably not part of the original text of Luke. They are absent
from the oldest papyrus manuscripts of Luke and from manuscripts of wide
geographical distribution.
15
 [51] And healed him: only Luke
recounts this healing of the injured servant.
16
 [61] Only Luke recounts that the
Lord turned and looked at Peter. This look of Jesus leads to Peter's weeping
bitterly over his denial (
⇒
 Luke 22:62).
17
 [66-71] Luke recounts one daytime
trial of Jesus (
⇒
 Luke 22:66-71) and hints at some
type of preliminary nighttime investigation (
⇒
22:54-65). Mark (and Matthew who follows Mark) has transferred
incidents of this day into the nighttime interrogation with the result that
there appear to be two Sanhedrin trials of Jesus in Mark (and Matthew); see the
note on 
⇒
 Mark 14:53.
18
 [66] Sanhedrin: the word is a
Hebraized form of a Greek word meaning a "council," and refers to the
elders, chief priests, and scribes who met under the high priest's leadership
to decide religious and legal questions that did not pertain to Rome's
interests. Jewish sources are not clear on the competence of the Sanhedrin to
sentence and to execute during this period.
