[1]
 When he looked up he saw some wealthy people
putting their offerings into the treasury 
2
and he noticed a poor widow putting in two
small coins. 
3
He said, "I tell you truly, this poor
widow put in more than all the rest; 
4
for those others have all made offerings from
their surplus wealth, but she, from her poverty, has offered her whole
livelihood." 
5
[2]
 While some people were speaking about how the
temple was adorned with costly stones and votive offerings, he said, 
6
"All that you see here - the days will
come when there will not be left a stone upon another stone that will not be
thrown down." 
7
Then they asked him, "Teacher, when will
this happen? And what sign will there be when all these things are about to
happen?" 
8
He answered, "See that you not be
deceived, for many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he,' and 'The time has
come.' 
[3]
 Do not follow them! 
9
When you hear of wars and insurrections, do not
be terrified; for such things must happen first, but it will not immediately be
the end." 
10
Then he said to them, "Nation will rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. 
11
There will be powerful earthquakes, famines,
and plagues from place to place; and awesome sights and mighty signs will come
from the sky. 
12
"Before all this happens, 
[4]
however, they will seize and persecute you, they will hand you over to the
synagogues and to prisons, and they will have you led before kings and
governors because of my name. 
13
It will lead to your giving testimony. 
14
Remember, you are not to prepare your defense
beforehand, 
15
for I myself shall give you a wisdom in
speaking 
[5]
 that all your adversaries will be powerless to
resist or refute. 
16
You will even be handed over by parents,
brothers, relatives, and friends, and they will put some of you to death. 
17
You will be hated by all because of my name, 
18
but not a hair on your head will be destroyed. 
19
By your perseverance you will secure your
lives. 
20
[6]
 "When you see Jerusalem surrounded by
armies, know that its desolation is at hand. 
21
Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
Let those within the city escape from it, and let those in the countryside not
enter the city, 
22
for these days are the time of punishment when
all the scriptures are fulfilled. 
23
Woe to pregnant women and nursing mothers in
those days, for a terrible calamity will come upon the earth and a wrathful
judgment upon this people. 
24
They will fall by the edge of the sword and be
taken as captives to all the Gentiles; and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot
by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles 
[7]
 are
fulfilled. 
25
"There will be signs in the sun, the moon,
and the stars, and on earth nations will be in dismay, perplexed by the roaring
of the sea and the waves. 
26
People will die of fright in anticipation of
what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens 
[8]
will be shaken. 
27
And then they will see the Son of Man coming in
a cloud with power and great glory. 
28
But when these signs begin to happen, stand
erect and raise your heads because your redemption is at hand." 
29
He taught them a lesson. "Consider the fig
tree and all the other trees. 
30
When their buds burst open, you see for
yourselves and know that summer is now near; 
31
in the same way, when you see these things
happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. 
32
Amen, I say to you, this generation will not pass
away until all these things have taken place. 
33
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words
will not pass away. 
34
"Beware that your hearts do not become
drowsy from carousing and drunkenness and the anxieties of daily life, and that
day catch you by surprise 
35
like a trap. For that day will assault everyone
who lives on the face of the earth. 
36
Be vigilant at all times and pray that you have
the strength to escape the tribulations that are imminent and to stand before
the Son of Man." 
37
During the day, Jesus was teaching in the
temple area, but at night he would leave and stay at the place called the Mount
of Olives. 
38
And all the people would get up early each
morning to listen to him in the temple area.

 [1-4] The widow is another example
of the poor ones in this gospel whose detachment from material possessions and
dependence on God leads to their blessedness (
⇒
6:20). Her simple offering provides a striking contrast to the pride
and pretentiousness of the scribes denounced in the preceding section
(
⇒
 Luke 20:45-47). The story is taken from
⇒
 Mark 12:41-44. 
2
 [5-36] Jesus' eschatological
discourse in Luke is inspired by Mark 13 but Luke has made some significant
alterations to the words of Jesus found there. Luke maintains, though in a
modified form, the belief in the early expectation of the end of the age (see
⇒
 Luke 21:27, 
⇒
 28,
⇒
 31, 
⇒
 32,
⇒
 36), but, by focusing attention throughout the
gospel on the importance of the day-to-day following of Jesus and by
reinterpreting the meaning of some of the signs of the end from Mark 13 he has
come to terms with what seemed to the early Christian community to be a delay
of the parousia. Mark, for example, described the desecration of the Jerusalem
temple by the Romans (
⇒
 Mark 13:14) as the
apocalyptic symbol (see 
⇒
 Daniel 9:27;
⇒
 12:11) accompanying the end of the age and the
coming of the Son of Man. Luke (
⇒
 Luke 21:20-24),
however, removes the apocalyptic setting and separates the historical
destruction of Jerusalem from the signs of the coming of the Son of Man by a
period that he refers to as "the times of the Gentiles"
(
⇒
 Luke 21:24). See also the notes on
⇒
 Matthew 24:1-36 and 
⇒
 Mark
13:1-37.
3
 [8] The time has come: in Luke, the
proclamation of the imminent end of the age has itself become a false teaching.
4
 [12] Before all this happens . . .
: to Luke and his community, some of the signs of the end just described
(
⇒
 Luke 21:10-11) still lie in the future. Now in
dealing with the persecution of the disciples (
⇒
21:12-19) and the destruction of Jerusalem (
⇒
21:20-24) Luke is pointing to eschatological signs that have already
been fulfilled.
5
 [15] A wisdom in speaking:
literally, "a mouth and wisdom."
6
 [20-24] The actual destruction of
Jerusalem by Rome in A.D. 70 upon which Luke and his community look back
provides the assurance that, just as Jesus' prediction of Jerusalem's
destruction was fulfilled, so too will be his announcement of their final
redemption (
⇒
 Luke 21:27-28).
7
 [24] The times of the Gentiles: a period
of indeterminate length separating the destruction of Jerusalem from the cosmic
signs accompanying the coming of the Son of Man.
8
 [26] The powers of the heavens: the
heavenly bodies mentioned in 
⇒
 Luke 21:25 and
thought of as cosmic armies.
