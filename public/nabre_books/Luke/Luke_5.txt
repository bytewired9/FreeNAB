[1]
 While the crowd was pressing in on Jesus and
listening to the word of God, he was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret. 
2
He saw two boats there alongside the lake; the
fishermen had disembarked and were washing their nets. 
3
Getting into one of the boats, the one
belonging to Simon, he asked him to put out a short distance from the shore.
Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat. 
4
After he had finished speaking, he said to
Simon, "Put out into deep water and lower your nets for a catch." 
5
Simon said in reply, "Master, we have
worked hard all night and have caught nothing, but at your command I will lower
the nets." 
6
When they had done this, they caught a great
number of fish and their nets were tearing. 
7
They signaled to their partners in the other
boat to come to help them. They came and filled both boats so that they were in
danger of sinking. 
8
When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at the knees
of Jesus and said, "Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man." 
9
For astonishment at the catch of fish they had
made seized him and all those with him, 
10
and likewise James and John, the sons of
Zebedee, who were partners of Simon. Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be
afraid; from now on you will be catching men." 
11
When they brought their boats to the shore,
they left everything 
[2]
 and followed him. 
12
Now there was a man full of leprosy 
[3]
in one of the towns where he was; and when he saw Jesus, he fell prostrate,
pleaded with him, and said, "Lord, if you wish, you can make me
clean." 
13
Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him, and
said, "I do will it. Be made clean." And the leprosy left him
immediately. 
14
Then he ordered him not to tell anyone, but
"Go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses
prescribed; 
[4]
 that will be proof for them." 
15
The report about him spread all the more, and
great crowds assembled to listen to him and to be cured of their ailments, 
16
but he would withdraw to deserted places to
pray. 
17
[5]
[6]
 One day as Jesus was
teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there who had come
from every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem, and the power of the
Lord was with him for healing. 
18
And some men brought on a stretcher a man who
was paralyzed; they were trying to bring him in and set (him) in his presence. 
19
But not finding a way to bring him in because
of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on the stretcher through
the tiles 
[7]
 into the middle in front of Jesus. 
20
When he saw their faith, he said, "As for
you, your sins are forgiven." 
[8]
21
Then the scribes 
[9]
 and
Pharisees began to ask themselves, "Who is this who speaks blasphemies?
Who but God alone can forgive sins?" 
22
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them in
reply, "What are you thinking in your hearts? 
23
Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are
forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'? 
24
[10]
 But that you may know that the Son of Man has
authority on earth to forgive sins'' - he said to the man who was paralyzed, "I
say to you, rise, pick up your stretcher, and go home." 
25
He stood up immediately before them, picked up
what he had been lying on, and went home, glorifying God. 
26
Then astonishment seized them all and they
glorified God, and, struck with awe, they said, "We have seen incredible
things today." 
27
After this he went out and saw a tax collector
named Levi sitting at the customs post. He said to him, "Follow me." 
28
And leaving everything behind, 
[11]
he got up and followed him. 
29
Then Levi gave a great banquet for him in his
house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were at table with them. 
30
The Pharisees and their scribes complained to
his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and
sinners?" 
31
Jesus said to them in reply, "Those who
are healthy do not need a physician, but the sick do. 
32
I have not come to call the righteous to
repentance but sinners." 
33
And they said to him, "The disciples of
John fast often and offer prayers, and the disciples of the Pharisees do the
same; but yours eat and drink." 
34
[12]
 Jesus answered them, "Can you make the
wedding guests 
[13]
 fast while the bridegroom is with them? 
35
But the days will come, and when the bridegroom
is taken away from them, then they will fast in those days." 
36
[14]
 And he also told them a parable. "No one
tears a piece from a new cloak to patch an old one. Otherwise, he will tear the
new and the piece from it will not match the old cloak. 
37
Likewise, no one pours new wine into old wineskins.
Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the
skins will be ruined. 
38
Rather, new wine must be poured into fresh
wineskins. 
39
(And) no one who has been drinking old wine desires
new, for he says, 'The old is good.'"

 [1-11] This incident has been
transposed from his source, 
⇒
 Mark 1:16-20, which
places it immediately after Jesus makes his appearance in Galilee. By this
transposition Luke uses this example of Simon's acceptance of Jesus to counter
the earlier rejection of him by his hometown people, and since several
incidents dealing with Jesus' power and authority have already been narrated,
Luke creates a plausible context for the acceptance of Jesus by Simon and his
partners. Many commentators have noted the similarity between the wondrous
catch of fish reported here (
⇒
 Luke 4:4-9) and the
post-resurrectional appearance of Jesus in 
⇒
 John
21:1-11. There are traces in Luke's story that the
post-resurrectional context is the original one: in 
⇒
4:8 Simon addresses Jesus as Lord (a post-resurrectional title for
Jesus - see 
⇒
 Luke 24:34; 
⇒
 Acts
2:36 - that has been read back into the historical ministry of Jesus)
and recognizes himself as a sinner (an appropriate recognition for one who has
denied knowing Jesus - 
⇒
 Luke 22:54-62). As used by
Luke, the incident looks forward to Peter's leadership in Luke - Acts
(
⇒
 Luke 6:14; 
⇒
 9:20;
⇒
 22:31-32; 
⇒
 24:34;
⇒
 Acts 1:15; 
⇒
 2:14-40;
⇒
 10:11-18; 
⇒
 15:7-12)
and symbolizes the future success of Peter as fisherman
(
⇒
 Acts 2:41). 
2
 [11] They left everything: in
⇒
 Mark 1:16-20 and 
⇒
 Matthew 4:18-22
the fishermen who follow Jesus leave their nets and their father; in Luke, they
leave everything (see also 
⇒
 Luke 5:28;
⇒
 12:33; 
⇒
 14:33;
⇒
 18:22), an indication of Luke's theme of complete
detachment from material possessions.

 [12] Full of leprosy: see the note
on 
⇒
 Mark 1:40.
4
 [14] Show yourself to the priest .
. . what Moses prescribed: this is a reference to 
⇒
 Lev
14:2-9 that gives detailed instructions for the purification of one
who had been a victim of leprosy and thereby excluded from contact with others
(see 
⇒
 Lev 13:45-46, 
⇒
 49;
⇒
 Numbers 5:2-3). That will be proof for them: see
the note on 
⇒
 Matthew 8:4.

[
⇒
 5:17-
⇒
 6:11] From his
Marcan source, Luke now introduces a series of controversies with Pharisees:
controversy over Jesus' power to forgive sins (
⇒
5:17-26); controversy over his eating and drinking with tax
collectors and sinners (
⇒
 Luke 5:27-32); controversy
over not fasting (
⇒
 Luke 5:33-36); and finally two
episodes narrating controversies over observance of the sabbath
(
⇒
 Luke 5:1-11).

 [19] Through the tiles: Luke has
adapted the story found in Mark to his non-Palestinian audience by changing
"opened up the roof" (
⇒
 Mark 2:4 a
reference to Palestinian straw and clay roofs) to through the tiles, a detail
that reflects the Hellenistic Greco-Roman house with tiled roof.
8
 [20] As for you, your sins are
forgiven: literally, "O man, your sins are forgiven you." The
connection between the forgiveness of sins and the cure of the paralytic
reflects the belief of first-century Palestine (based on the Old Testament:
⇒
 Exodus 20:5; 
⇒
 Deut 5:9)
that sickness and infirmity are the result of sin, one's own or that of one's
ancestors (see also 
⇒
 Luke 13:2;
⇒
 John 5:14; 
⇒
 9:2).

 [39] The old is good: this saying
is meant to be ironic and offers an explanation for the rejection by some of
the new wine that Jesus offers: satisfaction with old forms will prevent one
from sampling the new.
