[1]
 Afterward he journeyed from one town and
village to another, preaching and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of
God. Accompanying him were the Twelve 
2
and some women who had been cured of evil
spirits and infirmities, Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had
gone out, 
3
Joanna, the wife of Herod's steward Chuza,
Susanna, and many others who provided for them out of their resources. 
4
[2]
[3]
 When a large crowd
gathered, with people from one town after another journeying to him, he spoke
in a parable. 
5
"A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he
sowed, some seed fell on the path and was trampled, and the birds of the sky
ate it up. 
6
Some seed fell on rocky ground, and when it
grew, it withered for lack of moisture. 
7
Some seed fell among thorns, and the thorns
grew with it and choked it. 
8
And some seed fell on good soil, and when it
grew, it produced fruit a hundredfold." After saying this, he called out,
"Whoever has ears to hear ought to hear." 
9
Then his disciples asked him what the meaning
of this parable might be. 
10
He answered, "Knowledge of the mysteries
of the kingdom of God has been granted to you; but to the rest, they are made
known through parables so that 'they may look but not see, and hear but not
understand.' 
11
[4]
 "This is the meaning of the parable. The
seed is the word of God. 
12
Those on the path are the ones who have heard,
but the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts that they may not
believe and be saved. 
13
Those on rocky ground are the ones who, when
they hear, receive the word with joy, but they have no root; they believe only
for a time and fall away in time of trial. 
14
As for the seed that fell among thorns, they
are the ones who have heard, but as they go along, they are choked by the
anxieties and riches and pleasures of life, and they fail to produce mature
fruit. 
15
But as for the seed that fell on rich soil,
they are the ones who, when they have heard the word, embrace it with a
generous and good heart, and bear fruit through perseverance. 
16
[5]
 "No one who lights a lamp conceals it
with a vessel or sets it under a bed; rather, he places it on a lampstand so
that those who enter may see the light. 
17
For there is nothing hidden that will not
become visible, and nothing secret that will not be known and come to light. 
18
Take care, then, how you hear. To anyone who
has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he seems to
have will be taken away." 
19
Then his mother and his brothers 
[6]
came to him but were unable to join him because of the crowd. 
20
He was told, "Your mother and your
brothers are standing outside and they wish to see you." 
21
He said to them in reply, "My mother and
my brothers are those who hear the word of God and act on it." 
[7]
22
[8]
 One day he got into a boat with his disciples
and said to them, "Let us cross to the other side of the lake." So
they set sail, 
23
and while they were sailing he fell asleep. A
squall blew over the lake, and they were taking in water and were in danger. 
24
They came and woke him saying, "Master,
master, we are perishing!" He awakened, rebuked the wind and the waves,
and they subsided and there was a calm. 
25
Then he asked them, "Where is your
faith?" But they were filled with awe and amazed and said to one another,
"Who then is this, who commands even the winds and the sea, and they obey
him?" 
26
Then they sailed to the territory of the
Gerasenes, 
[9]
 which is opposite Galilee. 
27
When he came ashore a man from the town who was
possessed by demons met him. For a long time he had not worn clothes; he did
not live in a house, but lived among the tombs. 
28
When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down
before him; in a loud voice he shouted, "What have you to do with me,
Jesus, son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me!" 
29
For he had ordered the unclean spirit to come
out of the man. (It had taken hold of him many times, and he used to be bound
with chains and shackles as a restraint, but he would break his bonds and be
driven by the demon into deserted places.) 
30
Then Jesus asked him, "What is your
name?" 
[10]
 He replied, "Legion," because many
demons had entered him. 
31
And they pleaded with him not to order them to
depart to the abyss. 
[11]
32
A herd of many swine was feeding there on the
hillside, and they pleaded with him to allow them to enter those swine; and he
let them. 
33
The demons came out of the man and entered the
swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. 
34
When the swineherds saw what had happened, they
ran away and reported the incident in the town and throughout the countryside. 
35
People came out to see what had happened and,
when they approached Jesus, they discovered the man from whom the demons had
come out sitting at his feet. 
[12]
 He was clothed and in his
right mind, and they were seized with fear. 
36
Those who witnessed it told them how the
possessed man had been saved. 
37
The entire population of the region of the
Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them because they were seized with great fear.
So he got into a boat and returned. 
38
The man from whom the demons had come out
begged to remain with him, but he sent him away, saying, 
39
"Return home and recount what God has done
for you." The man went off and proclaimed throughout the whole town what
Jesus had done for him. 
40
[13]
 When Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him,
for they were all waiting for him. 
41
And a man named Jairus, an official of the
synagogue, came forward. He fell at the feet of Jesus and begged him to come to
his house, 
42
because he had an only daughter, 
[14]
about twelve years old, and she was dying. As he went, the crowds almost
crushed him. 
43
And a woman afflicted with hemorrhages for
twelve years, 
[15]
 who (had spent her whole livelihood on
doctors and) was unable to be cured by anyone, 
44
came up behind him and touched the tassel on
his cloak. Immediately her bleeding stopped. 
45
Jesus then asked, "Who touched me?"
While all were denying it, Peter said, "Master, the crowds are pushing and
pressing in upon you." 
46
But Jesus said, "Someone has touched me;
for I know that power has gone out from me." 
47
When the woman realized that she had not escaped
notice, she came forward trembling. Falling down before him, she explained in
the presence of all the people why she had touched him and how she had been
healed immediately. 
48
He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has
saved you; go in peace." 
49
While he was still speaking, someone from the
synagogue official's house arrived and said, "Your daughter is dead; do
not trouble the teacher any longer." 
50
On hearing this, Jesus answered him, "Do not
be afraid; just have faith and she will be saved." 
51
When he arrived at the house he allowed no one
to enter with him except Peter and John and James, and the child's father and
mother. 
52
[16]
 All were weeping and mourning for her, when he
said, "Do not weep any longer, for she is not dead, but sleeping." 
53
And they ridiculed him, because they knew that
she was dead. 
54
But he took her by the hand and called to her,
"Child, arise!" 
55
Her breath returned and she immediately arose.
He then directed that she should be given something to eat. 
56
Her parents were astounded, and he instructed
them to tell no one what had happened. 
1
 [1-3] Luke presents Jesus as an
itinerant preacher traveling in the company of the Twelve and of the Galilean
women who are sustaining them out of their means. These Galilean women will
later accompany Jesus on his journey to Jerusalem and become witnesses to his
death (
⇒
 Luke 23:49) and resurrection
(
⇒
 Luke 24:9-11, where Mary Magdalene and Joanna are
specifically mentioned; cf also 
⇒
 Acts 1:14). The
association of women with the ministry of Jesus is most unusual in the light of
the attitude of first-century Palestinian Judaism toward women. The more common
attitude is expressed in 
⇒
 John 4:27, and early
rabbinic documents caution against speaking with women in public. 
2
 [4-21] The focus in this section is
on how one should hear the word of God and act on it. It includes the parable
of the sower and its explanation (
⇒
 Luke 8:4-15), a
collection of sayings on how one should act on the word that is heard
(
⇒
 Luke 8:16-18), and the identification of the
mother and brothers of Jesus as the ones who hear the word and act on it
(
⇒
 Luke 8:19-21). See also the notes on
⇒
 Matthew 13:1-53 and 
⇒
 Mark
4:1-34.
3
 [4-8] See the note on
⇒
 Matthew 13:3-8.
4
 [11-15] On the interpretation of
the parable of the sower, see the note on 
⇒
 Matthew 13:18-23.
5
 [16-18] These sayings continue the
theme of responding to the word of God. Those who hear the word must become a
light to others (
⇒
 Luke 8:16); even the mysteries of
the kingdom that have been made known to the disciples (
⇒
8:9-10) must come to light (
⇒
 Luke 8:17);
a generous and persevering response to the word of God leads to a still more
perfect response to the word.
6
 [19] His brothers: see the note on
⇒
 Mark 6:3.
7
 [21] The family of Jesus is not
constituted by physical relationship with him but by obedience to the word of
God. In this, Luke agrees with the Marcan parallel (
⇒
 Mark
3:31-35), although by omitting 
⇒
 Mark 3:33
and especially 
⇒
 Mark 3:20-21 Luke has softened the
Marcan picture of Jesus' natural family. Probably he did this because Mary has
already been presented in 
⇒
 Luke 1:38 as the
obedient handmaid of the Lord who fulfills the requirement for belonging to the
eschatological family of Jesus; cf also 
⇒
11:27-28.
8
 [22-56] This section records four
miracles of Jesus that manifest his power and authority: (1) the calming of a
storm on the lake (
⇒
 Luke 8:22-25); (2) the exorcism
of a demoniac (
⇒
 Luke 8:26-39); (3) the cure of a
hemorrhaging woman (
⇒
 Luke 8:40-48); (4) the raising
of Jairus's daughter to life (49-56). They parallel the same sequence of
stories at 
⇒
 Mark
4:35-
⇒
 5:43.
9
 [26] Gerasenes: other manuscripts
read Gadarenes or Gergesenes. See also the note on 
⇒
 Matthew
8:28. Opposite Galilee: probably Gentile territory (note the presence
in the area of pigs - unclean animals to Jews) and an indication that the person
who receives salvation (
⇒
 Luke 8:36) is a Gentile.
10
 [30] What is your name?: the
question reflects the popular belief that knowledge of the spirit's name
brought control over the spirit. Legion: to Jesus' question the demon replies
with a Latin word transliterated into Greek. The Roman legion at this period
consisted of 5,000 to 6,000 foot soldiers; hence the name implies a very large
number of demons.
11
 [31] Abyss: the place of the dead
(
⇒
 Romans 10:7) or the prison of Satan
(
⇒
 Rev 20:3) or the subterranean "watery
deep" that symbolizes the chaos before the order imposed by creation
(
⇒
 Genesis 1:2).
12
 [35] Sitting at his feet: the
former demoniac takes the position of a disciple before the master
(
⇒
 Luke 10:39; 
⇒
 Acts
22:3).
13
 [40-56] Two interwoven miracle
stories, one a healing and the other a resuscitation, present Jesus as master
over sickness and death. In the Lucan account, faith in Jesus is responsible
for the cure (
⇒
 Luke 8:48) and for the raising to
life (
⇒
 Luke 8:50).
14
 [42] An only daughter: cf the son
of the widow of Nain whom Luke describes as an "only" son
(
⇒
 Luke 7:12; see also 
⇒
9:38).
15
 [43] Afflicted with hemorrhages for
twelve years: according to the Mosaic law (
⇒
 Lev
15:25-30) this condition would render the woman unclean and unfit for
contact with other people.
16
 [52] Sleeping: her death is a
temporary condition; cf 
⇒
 John 11:11-14.
