Yes, in those days, and at that time, when I
would restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, 
2
[1]
 I will assemble all the nations and bring them
down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, And I will enter into judgment with them
there on behalf of my people and my inheritance, Israel; Because they have
scattered them among the nations, and divided my land. 
3
Over my people they have cast lots; they gave a
boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for the wine they drank. 
4
Moreover, what are you to me, Tyre and Sidon,
and all the regions of Philistia? Would you take vengeance upon me by some
action? But if you do take action against me, swiftly, speedily, I will return
your deed upon your own head. 
5
You took my silver and my gold, and brought my
precious treasures into your temples! 
6
You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to
the Greeks, removing them far from their own country! 
7
See, I will rouse them from the place into
which you have sold them, and I will return your deed upon your own head. 
8
[2]
 I will sell your sons and your daughters to
the people of Judah, who shall sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far off.
Indeed, the LORD has spoken. 
9
Declare this among the nations: proclaim a war,
rouse the warriors to arms! Let all the soldiers report and march! 
10
[3]
 Beat your plowshares into swords, and your
pruning hooks into spears; let the weak man say, "I am a warrior!" 
11
[4]
 Hasten and come, all you neighboring peoples,
assemble there! (Bring down, O Lord, your warriors!) 
12
Let the nations bestir themselves and come up
to the Valley of Jehoshaphat; For there I will sit in judgment upon all the
neighboring nations. 
13
[5]
 Apply the sickle, for the harvest is ripe;
Come and tread, for the wine press is full; The vats overflow, for great is
their malice. 
14
Crowd upon crowd in the valley of decision; For
near is the day of the LORD in the valley of decision. 
15
Sun and moon are darkened, and the stars
withhold their brightness. 
16
The LORD roars from Zion, and from Jerusalem
raises his voice; The heavens and the earth quake, but the LORD is a refuge to
his people, a stronghold to the men of Israel. 
17
Then shall you know that I, the LORD, am your
God, dwelling on Zion, my holy mountain; Jerusalem shall be holy, and strangers
shall pass through her no more. 
18
[6]
 And then, on that day, the mountains shall
drip new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk; And the channels of Judah
shall flow with water: A fountain shall issue from the house of the LORD, to
water the Valley of Shittim. 
19
Egypt shall be a waste, and Edom a desert
waste, Because of violence done to the people of Judah, because they shed
innocent blood in their land. 
20
But Judah shall abide forever, and Jerusalem
for all generations. 
21
I will avenge their blood, and not leave it
unpunished. The LORD dwells in Zion. 
1
 [2] Valley of Jehoshaphat: a
symbolic name of the place of final judgment (
⇒
4:14). The name Jehoshaphat signifies "Yahweh judges." This
place has been popularly identified with the Kidron Valley. 
2
 [8] Sabeans: a south Arabian people
known for their commerce.
3
 [10] This imagery is used in the
reverse sense in 
⇒
 Isaiah 2:4;
⇒
 Micah 4:3. Here the warlike weapons are made in
response to God's summons to armies which he selected to expel forever the
unlawful invaders from the land of his chosen people.
4
 [11] Warriors: the angels; cf
⇒
 Zechariah 14:5.
5
 [13] Because of their numerous
crimes, the nations are ripe for punishment. The use of warlike weapons against
them is likened to the onslaught on the fields and vines at harvest time.
6
 [18] The Valley of Shittim, or
"the ravine of the acacia trees": perhaps a part of the Kidron Valley
southeast of Jerusalem; the prophetic picture of a stream of water flowing from
a fountain in the temple of Jerusalem is to be found in
⇒
 Ezekiel 47:1. The Shittim east of the Jordan (see
note on 
⇒
 Numbers 25:1) is hardly referred to here.
