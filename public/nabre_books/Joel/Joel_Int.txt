Introduction
This prophecy is
rich in apocalyptic imagery and strongly eschatological in tone. It was
composed about 400 B.C. Its prevailing theme is the day of the Lord.
A terrible invasion of
locusts ravaged Judah. So frightful was the scourge that the prophet visualized
it as a symbol of the coming day of the Lord. In the face of this threatening
catastrophe, the prophet summoned the people to repent, to turn to the Lord
with fasting and weeping. They were ordered to convoke a solemn assembly in
which the priests would pray for deliverance. The Lord answered their prayer
and promised to drive away the locusts and bless the land with peace and
prosperity. To these material blessings would be added an outpouring of the
spirit on all flesh. St. Peter, in his first discourse before the people at
Pentecost (
⇒
 Acts 2:16-21), sees in the coming of
the Holy Spirit the fulfillment of this promise (
⇒
 Joel 1:1-2:32(
⇒
 3:5)).
The concluding poem
pictures the nations gathered in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, where the Lord is
about to pass judgment. Israel's enemies are summoned to hear the solemn indictment;
their evil deeds are at last requited. The tumultuous throng assembled in the
valley of decision is made up of the enemies of God and they face inevitable
destruction. The oracle changes abruptly from the terrifying image of judgment
to a vision of Israel restored and forever secure from her enemies. God is both
the vindicator of his people and the source of their blessing
(
