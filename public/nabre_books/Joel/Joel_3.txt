 Then afterward I will pour out my spirit upon
all mankind. Your sons and daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream
dreams, your young men shall see visions; 
2
Even upon the servants and the handmaids, in
those days, I will pour out my spirit. 
3
And I will work wonders in the heavens and on
the earth, blood, fire, and columns of smoke; 
4
The sun will be turned to darkness, and the
moon to blood, At the coming of the Day of the LORD, the great and terrible
day. 
5
Then everyone shall be rescued who calls on the
name of the LORD; For on Mount Zion there shall be a remnant, as the LORD has
said, And in Jerusalem survivors whom the LORD shall call.
