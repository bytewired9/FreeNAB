Remember, O LORD, what has befallen us, look,
and see our disgrace: 
2
Our inherited lands have been turned over to
strangers, our homes to foreigners. 
3
We have become orphans, fatherless; widowed are
our mothers. 
4
The water we drink we must buy, for our own
wood we must pay. 
5
On our necks is the yoke of those who drive us;
we are worn out, but allowed no rest. 
6
[1]
 To Egypt we submitted, and to Assyria, to fill
our need of bread. 
7
[2]
 Our fathers, who sinned, are no more; but we
bear their guilt. 
8
[3]
 Slaves rule over us; there is no one to rescue
us from their hands. 
9
At the peril of our lives we bring in our
sustenance, in the face of the desert heat; 
10
Our skin is shriveled up, as though by a
furnace, with the searing blasts of famine. 
11
The wives in Zion were ravished by the enemy,
the maidens in the cities of Judah; 
12
Princes were gibbeted by them, elders shown no
respect. 
13
The youths carry the millstones, boys stagger
under their loads of wood; 
14
[4]
 The old men have abandoned the gate, the young
men their music. 
15
The joy of our hearts has ceased, our dance has
turned into mourning; 
16
The garlands have fallen from our heads: woe to
us, for we have sinned! 
17
Over this our hearts are sick, at this our eyes
grow dim: 
18
That Mount Zion should be desolate, with
jackals roaming there! 
19
You, O LORD, are enthroned forever; your throne
stands from age to age. 
20
Why, then, should you forget us, abandon us so
long a time? 
21
Lead us back to you, O LORD, that we may be
restored: give us anew such days as we had of old. 
22
For now you have indeed rejected us, and in
full measure turned your wrath against us.

 [6] In its state of abjection,
Judah was forced to depend on its traditional enemies to the west and the east
for subsistence. Mesopotamia is here called by the name it had long borne,
Assyria, though in these times the power of the Assyrians had been superseded
by that of the Chaldeans. 
2
 [7] Our fathers: collective
responsibility, for good and for evil, was recognized in the Old Testament; cf
⇒
 Jeremiah 31:29. But the present generation is
also personally guilty of sin (
⇒
 Lam 5:16).

 [8] Administrations imposed by
foreign powers were notoriously corrupt and inept. The Hebrew word for
"slave" is the same as that used for an official (servant of the
ruler); the author doubtless intends the double meaning here.

 [14] The gate: the place of
assembly, where city decisions were made and judgment given by the elders and
other notables; see note on

 Ruth 4:1.
