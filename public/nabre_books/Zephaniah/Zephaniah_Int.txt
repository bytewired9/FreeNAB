Introduction
The title of the
prophecy informs us that the ministry of Zephaniah took place during the reign
of Josiah (640-609 B.C.). The protest against the worship of false gods, and
the condemnation of the pro-Assyrian court ministers who served as regents
during Josiah's minority, allow us to place the work in the first decade of the
reign. Accordingly, the prophecy of Zephaniah comes rightly before that of
Jeremiah, who was probably influenced by it in both language and ideas.
The age of Zephaniah was a
time of religious degradation, when the old idolatries reappeared and men
worshiped sun, moon, and stars. Rites completely alien to the pure monotheism
taught by Moses flourished in Jerusalem. To the corrupt city Zephaniah
announced the impending judgment, the day of the Lord. The prophecy may be
divided into three sections, corresponding to the three chapters of the book:
The day of the Lord: A day
of doom. The last few verses of this oracle give the classic description of the
day of the Lord as an overwhelming disaster. The Christian hymn Dies Irae is
based on this passage (
⇒
 Zephaniah 1:2-18)
The day of the Lord: A day
of judgment of the nations, traditional enemies of God's people
(
⇒
 Zephaniah 2:1-15)
Reproach and Promise for
Jerusalem: Despite Judah's infidelities, the Lord in his mercy will spare a
holy remnant, which will finally enjoy peace. The prophecy closes with a hymn
of joy sung by the remnant restored to Zion (

3:1-20)
