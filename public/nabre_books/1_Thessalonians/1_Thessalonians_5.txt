1
Concerning times and seasons, brothers, you
have no need for anything to be written to you. 
2
For you yourselves know very well that the day
of the Lord will come like a thief at night. 
3
When people are saying, "Peace and
security," then sudden disaster comes upon them, like labor pains upon a
pregnant woman,and they will not escape. 
4
But you, brothers, are not in darkness, for
that day to overtake you like a thief. 
5
For all of you are children of the light 
[1]
and children of the day. We are not of the night or of darkness. 
6
Therefore, let us not sleep as the rest do, but
let us stay alert and sober. 
7
Those who sleep go to sleep at night, and those
who are drunk get drunk at night. 
8
But since we are of the day, let us be sober,
putting on the breastplate of faith and love and the helmet that is hope for
salvation. 
9
For God did not destine us for wrath, but to
gain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
10
who died for us, so that whether we are awake
or asleep we may live together with him. 
[2]
11
Therefore, encourage one another and build one
another up, as indeed you do. 
12
We ask you, brothers, to respect those who are
laboring among you and who are over you in the Lord and who admonish you, 
13
and to show esteem for them with special love
on account of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. 
14
We urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, cheer
the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient with all. 
15
See that no one returns evil for evil; rather,
always seek what is good (both) for each other and for all. 
16
Rejoice always. 
17
Pray without ceasing. 
18
In all circumstances give thanks, for this is
the will of God for you in Christ Jesus. 
19
[3]
 Do not quench the Spirit. 
20
Do not despise prophetic utterances. 
21
Test everything; retain what is good. 
22
Refrain from every kind of evil. 
23
[4]
 May the God of peace himself make you
perfectly holy and may you entirely, spirit, soul, and body, be preserved
blameless for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
24
The one who calls you is faithful, and he will
also accomplish it. 
25
Brothers, pray for us (too). 
26
Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss. 
[5]
27
I adjure you by the Lord that this letter be
read to all the brothers. 
28
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
1
 [5] Children of the light: that is,
belonging to the daylight of God's personal revelation and expected to achieve
it (an analogous development of imagery that appears in
⇒
 John 12:36). 
2
 [10] Characteristically, Paul plays
on words suggesting ultimate and anticipated death and life. Union with the
crucified and risen Lord at his parousia is anticipated in some measure in
contrasted states of our temporal life. The essential element he urges is our
indestructible personal union in Christ's own life (see 
⇒
 Romans
5:1-10).
3
 [19-21] Paul's buoyant
encouragement of charismatic freedom sometimes occasioned excesses that he or
others had to remedy (see 1 Cor 14; 
⇒
 2 Thes 2:1-15;
⇒
 2 Peter 3:1-16).
4
 [23] Another possible translation
is, "May the God of peace himself make you perfectly holy and sanctify
your spirit fully, and may both soul and body be preserved blameless for the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." In either case, Paul is not offering an
anthropological or philosophical analysis of human nature. Rather, he looks to
the wholeness of what may be called the supernatural and natural aspects of a
person's service of God.
5
 [26] Kiss: the holy embrace (see
⇒
 Romans 16:16; 
⇒
 1 Cor
16:20; 
⇒
 2 Cor 13:12;
⇒
 1 Peter 5:14) was a greeting of respect and
affection, perhaps given during a liturgy at which Paul's letter would have
been read.
