Introduction
The Book of Job,
named after its protagonist, is an exquisite dramatic poem which treats of the
problem of the suffering of the innocent, and of retribution. The contents of
the book, together with its artistic structure and elegant style, place it
among the literary masterpieces of all time.
Job, an oriental chieftain,
pious and upright, richly endowed in his own person and in domestic prosperity,
suffers a sudden and complete reversal of fortune. He loses his property and
his children; a loathsome disease afflicts his body; and sorrow oppresses his
soul. Nevertheless, Job does not complain against God. When some friends visit
him to condole with him, Job protests his innocence and does not understand why
he is afflicted. He curses the day of his birth and longs for death to bring an
end to his sufferings. The debate which ensues consists of three cycles of
speeches. Job's friends insist that his plight can only be a punishment for
personal wrongdoing and an invitation from God to repentance. Job rejects their
inadequate explanation and calls for a response from God himself. At this point
the speeches of a youth named Elihu (Job 32-37) interrupt the development.
In response to Job's plea
that he be allowed to see God and hear from him the cause of his suffering, God
answers, not by justifying his action before men, but by referring to his own
omniscience and almighty power. Job is content with this. He recovers his attitude
of humility and trust in God, which is deepened now and strengthened by his
experience of suffering.
The author of the book is
not known; it was composed some time between the seventh and fifth centuries
B.C. Its literary form, with speeches, prologue and epilogue disposed according
to a studied plan, indicates that the purpose of the writing is didactic. The
lesson is that even the just may suffer here, and their sufferings are a test
of their fidelity. They shall be rewarded in the end. Man's finite mind cannot
probe the depths of the divine omniscience that governs the world. The problems
we encounter can be solved by a broader and deeper awareness of God's power,
