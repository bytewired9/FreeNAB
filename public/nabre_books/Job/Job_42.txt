1
Then Job answered the LORD and said: 
2
[1]
 I know that you can do all things, and that no
purpose of yours can be hindered. 
3
I have dealt with great things that I do not
understand; things too wonderful for me, which I cannot know. 
5
I had heard of you by word of mouth, but now my
eye has seen you. 
6
Therefore I disown what I have said, and repent
in dust and ashes. 
7
[2]
 And it came to pass after the LORD had spoken these
words to Job, that the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "I am angry with
you and with your two friends; for you have not spoken rightly concerning me,
as has my servant Job. 
8
[3]
 Now, therefore, take seven bullocks and seven
rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up a holocaust for yourselves; and
let my servant Job pray for you; for his prayer I will accept, not to punish
you severely. For you have not spoken rightly concerning me, as has my servant
Job." 
9
Then Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the
Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, went and did as the LORD had commanded
them. And the LORD accepted the intercession of Job. 
10
Also, the LORD restored the prosperity of Job,
after he had prayed for his friends; the LORD even gave to Job twice as much as
he had before. 
11
[4]
 Then all his brethren and his sisters came to
him, and all his former acquaintances, and they dined with him in his house.
They condoled with him and comforted him for all the evil which the LORD had
brought upon him; and each one gave him a piece of money and a gold ring. 
12
Thus the LORD blessed the latter days of Job
more than his earlier ones. For he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand
camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses. 
13
And he had seven sons and three daughters, 
14
[5]
 of whom he called the first Jemimah, the
second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. 
15
[6]
 In all the land no other women were as
beautiful as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance
among their brethren. 
16
[7]
 After this, Job lived a hundred and forty
years; and he saw his children, his grandchildren, and even his
great-grandchildren. 
17
Then Job died, old and full of years. 
1
 [2-6] In the current Hebrew text,
this final utterance of Job is interrupted by words ascribed to God (
⇒
42:3-4) which are in large part a duplication of
⇒
 Job 38:2-3. 
2
 [7] The three friends of Job (Elihu
is ignored in the Epilogue) are criticized by the LORD because they had (even
though in good faith) leveled false charges against him.
3
 [8] Job becomes the intercessor for
his friends, as were other great Old Testament characters, e.g., Abraham and
Moses, and as our Lord would be, whom he prefigured. Seven: a symbolic number.
4
 [11] A piece of money: the term is
the same as that used in 
⇒
 Genesis 33:19;
⇒
 Joshua 24:32. Gold ring: for the nose or ear.
5
 [14] Job's daughters had names
symbolic of their charms: Jemimah, dove; Keziah, precious perfume (cf
⇒
 Psalm 45:9); Kerenhappuch, cosmetic jar-more
precisely, a container for a black powder that was used like modern mascara.
6
 [15] Ordinarily daughters did not
inherit property unless there were no sons; cf 
⇒
 Numbers
27:1-11.
7
 [16] As his other rewards were
twice as much as he had before (
⇒
 Job 42:10) so
Job's hundred and forty years were double the expected span of human life; cf
⇒
 Psalm 90:10.
