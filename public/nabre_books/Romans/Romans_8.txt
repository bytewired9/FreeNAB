[1]
 Hence, now there is no condemnation for those
who are in Christ Jesus. 
2
For the law of the spirit of life in Christ
Jesus has freed you from the law of sin and death. 
3
For what the law, weakened by the flesh, was
powerless to do, this God has done: by sending his own Son in the likeness of
sinful flesh and for the sake of sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, 
4
so that the righteous decree of the law might
be fulfilled in us, who live not according to the flesh but according to the
spirit. 
5
For those who live according to the flesh are
concerned with the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the
spirit with the things of the spirit. 
6
The concern of the flesh is death, but the
concern of the spirit is life and peace. 
7
For the concern of the flesh is hostility
toward God; it does not submit to the law of God, nor can it; 
8
and those who are in the flesh cannot please
God. 
9
But you are not in the flesh; on the contrary,
you are in the spirit, if only the Spirit of God dwells in you. Whoever does
not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. 
10
But if Christ is in you, although the body is
dead because of sin, the spirit is alive because of righteousness. 
11
If the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from
the dead dwells in you, the one who raised Christ from the dead will give life
to your mortal bodies also, through his Spirit that dwells in you. 
12
Consequently, brothers, we are not debtors to
the flesh, to live according to the flesh. 
13
For if you live according to the flesh, you
will die, but if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will
live. 
14
[2]
 For those who are led by the Spirit of God are
children of God. 
15
For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to
fall back into fear, but you received a spirit of adoption, through which we
cry, "Abba, 
[3]
 Father!" 
16
The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit
that we are children of God, 
17
and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and
joint heirs with Christ, if only we suffer with him so that we may also be
glorified with him. 
18
[4]
 I consider that the sufferings of this present
time are as nothing compared with the glory to be revealed for us. 
19
For creation awaits with eager expectation the
revelation of the children of God; 
20
for creation was made subject to futility, not
of its own accord but because of the one who subjected it, in hope 
21
that creation itself would be set free from
slavery to corruption and share in the glorious freedom of the children of God.
22
We know that all creation is groaning in labor
pains even until now; 
23
and not only that, but we ourselves, who have
the firstfruits of the Spirit, we also groan within ourselves as we wait for
adoption, the redemption of our bodies. 
24
For in hope we were saved. Now hope that sees
for itself is not hope. For who hopes for what one sees? 
25
But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait
with endurance. 
26
In the same way, the Spirit too comes to the
aid of our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit
itself intercedes with inexpressible groanings. 
27
And the one who searches hearts knows what is the
intention of the Spirit, because it intercedes for the holy ones according to
God's will. 
28
[5]
 We know that all things work for good for
those who love God, 
[6]
 who are called according to his
purpose. 
29
[7]
 For those he foreknew he also predestined to
be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he might be the firstborn among
many brothers. 
30
And those he predestined he also called; and
those he called he also justified; and those he justified he also glorified. 
31
[8]
 What then shall we say to this? If God is for
us, who can be against us? 
32
He who did not spare his own Son but handed him
over for us all, how will he not also give us everything else along with him? 
33
Who will bring a charge against God's chosen
ones? It is God who acquits us. 
34
Who will condemn? It is Christ (Jesus) who
died, rather, was raised, who also is at the right hand of God, who indeed
intercedes for us. 
35
What will separate us from the love of Christ?
Will anguish, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril,
or the sword? 
36
As it is written: "For your sake we are
being slain all the day; we are looked upon as sheep to be slaughtered." 
37
No, in all these things we conquer
overwhelmingly through him who loved us. 
38
For I am convinced that neither death, nor
life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor present things, 
[9]
nor future things, nor powers, 
39
nor height, nor depth, 
[10]
nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God in
Christ Jesus our Lord. 
1
 [1-13] After his warning in Romans
7 against the wrong route to fulfillment of the objective of holiness expressed
in 
⇒
 Romans 6:22, Paul points his addressees to the
correct way. Through the redemptive work of Christ, Christians have been
liberated from the terrible forces of sin and death. Holiness was impossible so
long as the flesh (or our "old self"), that is, self-interested
hostility toward God (
⇒
 Romans 8:7), frustrated the
divine objectives expressed in the law. What is worse, sin used the law to
break forth into all manner of lawlessness (
⇒
8:8). All this is now changed. At the cross God broke the power of
sin and pronounced sentence on it (
⇒
 Romans 8:3).
Christians still retain the flesh, but it is alien to their new being, which is
life in the spirit, namely the new self, governed by the holy Spirit. Under the
direction of the holy Spirit Christians are able to fulfill the divine will
that formerly found expression in the law (
⇒
8:4). The same Spirit who enlivens Christians for holiness will also
resurrect their bodies at the last day (
⇒
8:11). Christian life is therefore the experience of a constant
challenge to put to death the evil deeds of the body through life of the spirit
(
⇒
 Romans 8:13). 
2
 [14-17] Christians, by reason of
the Spirit's presence within them, enjoy not only new life but also a new
relationship to God, that of adopted children and heirs through Christ, whose
sufferings and glory they share.
3
 [15] Abba: see the note on
⇒
 Mark 14:36.
4
 [18-27] The glory that believers
are destined to share with Christ far exceeds the sufferings of the present
life. Paul considers the destiny of the created world to be linked with the
future that belongs to the believers. As it shares in the penalty of corrup
tion brought about by sin, so also will it share in the benefits of redemption
and future glory that comprise the ultimate liberation of God's people
(
⇒
 Romans 8:19-22). After patient endurance in
steadfast expectation, the full harvest of the Spirit's presence will be
realized. On earth believers enjoy the firstfruits, i.e., the Spirit, as a
guarantee of the total liberation of their bodies from the influence of the
rebellious old self (
⇒
 Romans 8:23).
5
 [28-30] These verses outline the
Christian vocation as it was designed by God: to be conformed to the image of
his Son, who is to be the firstborn among many brothers
(
⇒
 Romans 8:29). God's redemptive action on behalf
of the believers has been in process before the beginning of the world. Those
whom God chooses are those he foreknew (
⇒
8:29) or elected. Those who are called (
⇒
8:30) are predestined or predetermined. These expressions do not mean
that God is arbitrary. Rather, Paul uses them to emphasize the thought and care
that God has taken for the Christian's salvation.
6
 [28] We know that all things work
for good for those who love God: a few ancient authorities have God as the
subject of the verb, and some translators render: "We know that God makes
everything work for good for those who love God. . . ."
7
 [29] Image: while man and woman
were originally created in God's image (
⇒
 Genesis
1:26-27), it is through baptism into Christ, the image of God
(
⇒
 2 Cor 4:4; 
⇒
 Col
1:15), that we are renewed according to the image of the Creator
(
⇒
 Col 3:10).
8
 [31-39] The all-conquering power of
God's love has overcome every obstacle to Christians' salvation and every
threat to separate them from God. That power manifested itself fully when God's
own Son was delivered up to death for their salvation. Through him Christians
can overcome all their afflictions and trials.
9
 [38] Present things and future
things may refer to astrological data. Paul appears to be saying that the
gospel liberates believers from dependence on astrologers.
10
 [39] Height, depth may refer to
positions in the zodiac, positions of heavenly bodies relative to the horizon.
In astrological documents the term for "height" means
"exaltation" or the position of greatest influence exerted by a planet.
Since hostile spirits were associated with the planets and stars, Paul includes
powers (
⇒
 Romans 8:38) in his list of malevolent
forces.
