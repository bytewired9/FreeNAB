1
We who are strong ought to put up with the
failings of the weak and not to please ourselves; 
2
let each of us please our neighbor for the
good, for building up. 
3
For Christ did not please himself; but, as it
is written, "The insults of those who insult you fall upon me." 
[1]
4
For whatever was written previously was written
for our instruction, that by endurance and by the encouragement of the
scriptures we might have hope. 
5
May the God of endurance and encouragement
grant you to think in harmony 
[2]
 with one another, in keeping
with Christ Jesus, 
6
that with one accord you may with one voice
glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
7
[3]
 Welcome one another, then, as Christ welcomed
you, for the glory of God. 
8
For I say that Christ became a minister of the
circumcised to show God's truthfulness, to confirm the promises to the
patriarchs, 
9
but so that the Gentiles might glorify God for his
mercy. As it is written: "Therefore, I will praise you among the Gentiles
and sing praises to your name." 
10
And again it says: "Rejoice, O Gentiles,
with his people." 
[4]
11
And again: "Praise the Lord, all you
Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise him." 
12
And again Isaiah says: "The root of Jesse
shall come, raised up to rule the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles
hope." 
13
May the God of hope fill you with all joy and
peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the holy
Spirit. 
14
[5]
 I myself am convinced about you, my brothers,
that you yourselves are full of goodness, 
[6]
 filled with all
knowledge, and able to admonish one another. 
15
But I have written to you rather boldly in some
respects to remind you, because of the grace given me by God 
16
to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the
Gentiles in performing the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the
offering up of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the holy Spirit. 
17
In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to boast
in what pertains to God. 
18
For I will not dare to speak of anything except
what Christ has accomplished through me to lead the Gentiles to obedience by
word and deed, 
19
by the power of signs and wonders, by the power
of the Spirit (of God), so that from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum 
[7]
I have finished preaching the gospel of Christ. 
20
Thus I aspire 
[8]
 to proclaim
the gospel not where Christ has already been named, so that I do not build on
another's foundation, 
21
but as it is written: "Those who have
never been told of him shall see, and those who have never heard of him shall
understand." 
[9]
22
That is why I have so often been prevented from
coming to you. 
23
But now, since I no longer have any opportunity
in these regions and since I have desired to come to you for many years, 
24
I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain
and to be sent on my way there by you, after I have enjoyed being with you for
a time. 
25
[10]
 Now, however, I am going to Jerusalem to
minister to the holy ones. 
26
For Macedonia and Achaia 
[11]
have decided to make some contribution for the poor among the holy ones in Jerusalem;
27
they decided to do it, and in fact they are
indebted to them, for if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual
blessings, they ought also to serve them in material blessings. 
28
So when I have completed this and safely handed
over this contribution to them, I shall set out by way of you to Spain; 
29
and I know that in coming to you I shall come
in the fullness of Christ's blessing. 
30
I urge you, (brothers,) by our Lord Jesus
Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in the struggle by your
prayers to God on my behalf, 
31
that I may be delivered from the disobedient in
Judea, and that my ministry for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the holy ones, 
32
so that I may come to you with joy by the will
of God and be refreshed together with you. 
33
The God of peace be with all of you. Amen.

 [3] Liberation from the law of
Moses does not make the scriptures of the old covenant irrelevant. Much
consolation and motivation for Christian living can be derived from the Old
Testament, as in the citation from 
⇒
 Psalm 69:10.
Because this psalm is quoted several times in the New Testament, it has been
called indirectly messianic. 
2
 [5] Think in harmony: a Greco-Roman
ideal. Not rigid uniformity of thought and expression but thoughtful
consideration of other people's views finds expression here.
3
 [7-13] True oneness of mind is
found in pondering the ultimate mission of the church: to bring it about that
God's name be glorified throughout the world and that Jesus Christ be
universally recognized as God's gift to all humanity. Paul here prepares his
addressees for the climactic appeal he is about to make.
4
 [10] Paul's citation of
⇒
 Deut 32:43 follows the Greek version.
5
 [14-33] Paul sees himself as
apostle and benefactor in the priestly service of the gospel and so sketches
plans for a mission in Spain, supported by those in Rome.
6
 [14] Full of goodness: the opposite
of what humanity was filled with according to 
⇒
1:29-30.
7
 [19] Illyricum: Roman province
northwest of Greece on the eastern shore of the Adriatic.
8
 [20] I aspire: Paul uses
terminology customarily applied to philanthropists. Unlike some philanthropists
of his time, Paul does not engage in cheap competition for public acclaim. This
explanation of his missionary policy is to assure the Christians in Rome that
he is also not planning to remain in that city and build on other people's
foundations (cf 
⇒
 2 Cor 10:12-18). However, he
does solicit their help in sending him on his way to Spain, which was
considered the limit of the western world. Thus Paul's addressees realize that
evangelization may be understood in the broader sense of mission or, as in
⇒
 Romans 1:15, of instruction within the Christian
community that derives from the gospel.
9
 [21] The citation from
⇒
 Isaiah 52:15 concerns the Servant of the Lord.
According to Isaiah, the Servant is first of all Israel, which was to bring the
knowledge of Yahweh to the nations. In Romans 9-11 Paul showed how Israel
failed in this mission. Therefore, he himself undertakes almost singlehandedly
Israel's responsibility as the Servant and moves as quickly as possible with
the gospel through the Roman empire.
10
 [25-27] Paul may have viewed the
contribution he was gathering from Gentile Christians for the poor in Jerusalem
(cf 2 Cor 8-9) as a fulfillment of the vision of 
⇒
 Isaiah
60:5-6. In confidence that the messianic fulfillment was taking
place, Paul stresses in Romans 14-16 the importance of harmonious relationships
between Jews and Gentiles.

 [26] Achaia: the Roman province of
southern Greece.
