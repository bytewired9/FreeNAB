[1]
 What advantage is there then in being a Jew?
Or what is the value of circumcision? 
2
Much, in every respect. (For) in the first
place, they were entrusted with the utterances of God. 
3
What if some were unfaithful? Will their
infidelity nullify the fidelity of God? 
4
Of course not! God must be true, though every
human being is a liar, 
[2]
 as it is written: "That you
may be justified in your words, and conquer when you are judged." 
5
But if our wickedness provides proof of God's
righteousness, what can we say? Is God unjust, humanly speaking, to inflict his
wrath? 
6
Of course not! For how else is God to judge the
world? 
7
But if God's truth redounds to his glory
through my falsehood, why am I still being condemned as a sinner? 
8
And why not say - as we are accused and as some
claim we say - that we should do evil that good may come of it? Their penalty
is what they deserve. 
9
[3]
 Well, then, are we better off? Not entirely,
for we have already brought the charge against Jews and Greeks alike that they
are all under the domination of sin, 
10
as it is written: "There is no one just,
not one, 
11
there is no one who understands, there is no
one who seeks God. 
12
All have gone astray; all alike are worthless;
there is not one who does good, (there is not) even one. 
13
Their throats are open graves; they deceive with
their tongues; the venom of asps is on their lips; 
14
their mouths are full of bitter cursing. 
15
Their feet are quick to shed blood; 
16
ruin and misery are in their ways, 
17
and the way of peace they know not. 
18
There is no fear of God before their
eyes." 
19
Now we know that what the law 
[4]
says is addressed to those under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced
and the whole world stand accountable to God, 
20
since no human being will be justified in his
sight 
[5]
 by observing the law; for through the law comes
consciousness of sin. 
21
[6]
 But now 
[7]
 the righteousness
of God has been manifested apart from the law, though testified to by the law
and the prophets, 
22
the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus
Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction; 
23
all have sinned and are deprived of the glory
of God. 
24
They are justified freely by his grace through
the redemption in Christ Jesus, 
25
whom God set forth as an expiation, 
[8]
through faith, by his blood, to prove his righteousness because of the
forgiveness of sins previously committed, 
26
through the forbearance of God - to prove his
righteousness in the present time, that he might be righteous and justify the
one who has faith in Jesus. 
27
What occasion is there then for boasting? 
[9]
It is ruled out. On what principle, that of works? No, rather on the principle
of faith. 
[10]
28
For we consider that a person is justified by
faith apart from works of the law. 
29
Does God belong to Jews alone? Does he not
belong to Gentiles, too? Yes, also to Gentiles, 
30
for God is one and will justify the circumcised
on the basis of faith and the uncircumcised through faith. 
31
Are we then annulling the law by this faith? Of
course not! On the contrary, we are supporting the law. 
[11]
1
 [1-4] In keeping with the popular
style of diatribe, Paul responds to the objection that his teaching on the
sinfulness of all humanity detracts from the religious prerogatives of Israel.
He stresses that Jews have remained the vehicle of God's revelation despite
their sins, though this depends on the fidelity of God. 
2
 [4] Though every human being is a
liar: these words reproduce the Greek text of 
⇒
 Psalm
116:11. The rest of the verse is from 
⇒
 Psalm
51:6.
3
 [9-20] Well, then, are we better
off?: this phrase can also be translated "Are we at a disadvantage?"
but the latter version does not substantially change the overall meaning of the
passage. Having explained that Israel's privileged status is guaranteed by
God's fidelity, Paul now demonstrates the infidelity of the Jews by a catena of
citations from scripture, possibly derived from an existing collection of
testimonia. These texts show that all human beings share the common burden of
sin. They are linked together by mention of organs of the body: throat, tongue,
lips, mouth, feet, eyes.
4
 [19] The law: Paul here uses the
term in its broadest sense to mean all of the scriptures; none of the preceding
texts is from the Torah or Pentateuch.
5
 [20] No human being will be
justified in his sight: these words are freely cited from 
⇒
 Psalm
143:2. In place of the psalmist's "no living person," Paul
substitutes "no human being" (literally "no flesh," a
Hebraism), and he adds "by observing the law."
6
 [21-31] These verses provide a
clear statement of Paul's "gospel," i.e., the principle of
justification by faith in Christ. God has found a means of rescuing humanity
from its desperate plight: Paul's general term for this divine initiative is
the righteousness of God (
⇒
 Romans 3:21). Divine
mercy declares the guilty innocent and makes them so. God does this not as a
result of the law but apart from it (
⇒
 Romans 3:21),
and not because of any merit in human beings but through forgiveness of their
sins (
⇒
 Romans 3:24), in virtue of the redemption
wrought in Christ Jesus for all who believe (
⇒
3:22, 
⇒
 24-25). God has manifested his
righteousness in the coming of Jesus Christ, whose saving activity inaugurates
a new era in human history.
7
 [21] But now: Paul adopts a common
phrase used by Greek authors to describe movement from disaster to prosperity.
The expressions indicate that 
⇒
 Romans 3:21-26 are
the consolatory answer to 
⇒
 Romans 3:9-20.
8
 [25] Expiation: this rendering is
preferable to "propitiation," which suggests hostility on the part of
God toward sinners. As Paul will be at pains to point out (
⇒
5:8-10), it is humanity that is hostile to God.
9
 [27-31] People cannot boast of
their own holiness, since it is God's free gift (
⇒
3:27), both to the Jew who practices circumcision out of faith and to
the Gentile who accepts faith without the Old Testament religious culture
symbolized by circumcision (
⇒
 Romans 3:29-30).
10
 [27] Principle of faith: literally,
"law of faith." Paul is fond of wordplay involving the term
"law"; cf 
⇒
 Romans 7:21,
⇒
 23; 
⇒
 8:2. Since
"law" in Greek may also connote "custom" or
"principle," his readers and hearers would have sensed no contradiction
in the use of the term after the negative statement concerning law in
⇒
 Romans 3:20.
11
 [31] We are supporting the law:
giving priority to God's intentions. God is the ultimate source of law, and the
essence of law is fairness. On the basis of the Mosaic covenant, God's justice
is in question if those who sinned against the law are permitted to go free
(see 
⇒
 Romans 3:23-26). In order to rescue all
humanity rather than condemn it, God thinks of an alternative: the law or
"principle" of faith (
⇒
 Romans 3:27). What
can be more fair than to admit everyone into the divine presence on the basis
of forgiveness grasped by faith? Indeed, this principle of faith antedates the
Mosaic law, as Paul will demonstrate in Romans 4, and does not therefore mark a
change in divine policy.
