[1]
 Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God
on their behalf is for salvation. 
2
I testify with regard to them that they have
zeal for God, but it is not discerning. 
3
For, in their unawareness of the righteousness
that comes from God and their attempt to establish their own (righteousness),
they did not submit to the righteousness of God. 
4
For Christ is the end 
[2]
 of
the law for the justification of everyone who has faith. 
5
[3]
 Moses writes about the righteousness that
comes from (the) law, "The one who does these things will live by
them." 
6
But the righteousness that comes from faith
says, "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will go up into heaven?' (that is,
to bring Christ down) 
7
[4]
 or 'Who will go down into the abyss?' (that
is, to bring Christ up from the dead)." 
8
But what does it say? "The word is near you,
in your mouth and in your heart" (that is, the word of faith that we
preach), 
9
for, if you confess 
[5]
 with
your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him
from the dead, you will be saved. 
10
For one believes with the heart and so is
justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved. 
11
For the scripture says, "No one who
believes in him will be put to shame." 
12
For there is no distinction between Jew and
Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all, enriching all who call upon him. 
13
For "everyone who calls on the name of the
Lord will be saved." 
14
[6]
 But how can they call on him in whom they have
not believed? And how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And
how can they hear without someone to preach? 
15
And how can people preach unless they are sent?
As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring (the)
good news!" 
[7]
16
But not everyone has heeded the good news; for
Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed what was heard from us?" 
17
Thus faith comes from what is heard, and what
is heard comes through the word of Christ. 
18
But I ask, did they not hear? Certainly they
did; for "Their voice has gone forth to all the earth, and their words to
the ends of the world." 
19
But I ask, did not Israel understand? First
Moses says: "I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a
senseless nation I will make you angry." 
20
Then Isaiah speaks boldly and says: "I was
found (by) those who were not seeking me; I revealed myself to those who were
not asking for me." 
21
But regarding Israel he says, "All day
long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contentious people." 
1
 [1-13] Despite Israel's lack of
faith in God's act in Christ, Paul does not abandon hope for her salvation
(
⇒
 Romans 10:1). However, Israel must recognize that
the Messiah's arrival in the person of Jesus Christ means the termination of
the Mosaic law as the criterion for understanding oneself in a valid
relationship to God. Faith in God's saving action in Jesus Christ takes
precedence over any such legal claim (
⇒
10:6). 
2
 [4] The Mosaic legislation has been
superseded by God's action in Jesus Christ. Others understand end here in the
sense that Christ is the goal of the law, i.e., the true meaning of the Mosaic
law, which cannot be correctly understood apart from him. Still others believe
that both meanings are intended.
3
 [5-6] The subject of the verb says
(
⇒
 Romans 10:6) is righteousness personified. Both
of the statements in 
⇒
 Romans 10:5,
6 derive from Moses, but Paul wishes to contrast
the language of law and the language of faith.
4
 [7] Here Paul blends
⇒
 Deut 30:13 and 
⇒
 Psalm
107:26.
5
 [9-11] To confess Jesus as Lord was
frequently quite hazardous in the first century (cf 
⇒
 Matthew
10:18; 
⇒
 1 Thes 2:2; 
⇒
 1
Peter 2:18-21; 
⇒
 3:14). For a Jew it
could mean disruption of normal familial and other social relationships,
including great economic sacrifice. In the face of penalties imposed by the
secular world, Christians are assured that no one who believes in Jesus will be
put to shame (
⇒
 Romans 10:11).
6
 [14-21] The gospel has been
sufficiently proclaimed to Israel, and Israel has adequately understood God's plan
for the messianic age, which would see the gospel brought to the uttermost
parts of the earth. As often in the past, Israel has not accepted the prophetic
message; cf 
⇒
 Acts 7:51-53.
7
 [15] How beautiful are the feet of
those who bring [the] good news: in Semitic fashion, the parts of the body that
bring the messenger with welcome news are praised; cf 
⇒
 Luke
11:27.
