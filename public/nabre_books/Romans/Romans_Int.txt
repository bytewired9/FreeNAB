Introduction
Introduction
Of all the
letters of Paul, that to the Christians at Rome has long held pride of place.
It is the longest and most systematic unfolding of the apostle's thought,
expounding the gospel of God's righteousness that saves all who believe
(
⇒
 Romans 1:16-17); it reflects a universal outlook,
with special implications for Israel's relation to the church (Rom 9-11). Yet,
like all Paul's letters, Romans too arose out of a specific situation, when the
apostle wrote from Greece, likely Corinth, between A.D. 56 and 58 (cf
⇒
 Acts 20:2-3).
Paul at that time was about
to leave for Jerusalem with a collection of funds for the impoverished Jewish
Christian believers there, taken up from his predominantly Gentile
congregations (
⇒
 Romans 15:25-27). He planned then
to travel on to Rome and to enlist support there for a mission to Spain
(
⇒
 Romans 15:24, 
⇒
 28).
Such a journey had long been on his mind (
⇒
1:9-13; 
⇒
 15:23). Now, with much
missionary preaching successfully accomplished in the East
(
⇒
 Romans 15:19), he sought new opportunities in
the West (
⇒
 Romans 15:20-21), in order to complete
the divine plan of evangelization in the Roman world. Yet he recognized that
the visit to Jerusalem would be hazardous (
⇒
15:30-32), and we know from Acts that Paul was arrested there and
came to Rome only in chains, as a prisoner (Act 21-28, especially
⇒
 Acts 21:30-33 and 
⇒
 Acts
28:14, 
⇒
 30-31).
The existence of a
Christian community in Rome antedates Paul's letter there. When it arose,
likely within the sizable Jewish population at Rome, and how, we do not know.
The Roman historian Suetonius mentions an edict of the Emperor Claudius about
A.D. 49 ordering the expulsion of Jews from Rome in connection with a certain
"Chrestus," probably involving a dispute in the Jewish community over
Jesus as the Messiah ("Christus"). According to
⇒
 Acts 18:2, Aquila and Priscilla (or Prisca, as in
⇒
 Romans 16:3) were among those driven out; from
them, in Corinth, Paul may have learned about conditions in the church at Rome.
Opinions vary as to whether
Jewish or Gentile Christians predominated in the house churches (cf
⇒
 Romans 16:5) in the capital city of the empire at
the time Paul wrote. Perhaps already by then Gentile Christians were in the
majority. Paul speaks in Romans of both Jews and Gentiles
(
⇒
 Romans 3:9, 
⇒
 29; see
the note on 
⇒
 Romans 1:14). The letter also refers to
those "weak in faith" (
⇒
 Romans 14:1) and
those "who are strong" (
⇒
 Romans 15:1);
this terminology may reflect not so much differences between believers of
Jewish and of Gentile background, respectively, as an ascetic tendency in some
converts (
⇒
 Romans 14:2) combined with Jewish laws
about clean and unclean foods (
⇒
 Romans 14:14,
⇒
 20). The issues were similar to problems that
Paul had faced in Corinth (1 Cor 8). If Romans 16 is part of the letter to Rome
(see the note on 
⇒
 Romans 16:1-23), then Paul had
considerable information about conditions in Rome through all these people
there whom he knew, and our letter does not just reflect a generalized picture
of an earlier situation in Corinth.
In any case, Paul writes to
introduce himself and his message to the Christians at Rome, seeking to enlist
their support for the proposed mission to Spain. He therefore employs
formulations likely familiar to the Christians at Rome; see the note on the
confessional material at 
⇒
 Romans 1:3-4 and compare
⇒
 Romans 3:25-26; 
⇒
 4:25.
He cites the Old Testament frequently (
⇒
1:17; 
⇒
 3:10-18; 4;
⇒
 9:7, 
⇒
 12-13,
⇒
 15, 
⇒
 17, 
⇒
 25-29,
⇒
 33; 
⇒
 10:5-13,
⇒
 15-21; 
⇒
 15:9-12). The
gospel Paul presents is meant to be a familiar one to those in Rome, even
though they heard it first from other preachers.
As the outline below shows,
this gospel of Paul (see 
⇒
 Romans 16:25) finds its
center in salvation and justification through faith in Christ
(
⇒
 Romans 1:16-17). While God's wrath is revealed
against all sin and wickedness of Gentile and Jew alike
(
⇒
 Romans 1:18-
⇒
 3:20),
God's power to save by divine righteous or justifying action in Christ is also
revealed (
⇒
 Romans 1:16-17;
⇒
 3:21-
⇒
 5:21). The
consequences and implications for those who believe are set forth
(
⇒
 Romans 6:1-
⇒
 8:39), as
are results for those in Israel (Rom 9-11) who, to Paul's great sorrow
(
⇒
 Romans 9:1-5), disbelieve. The apostle's hope is
that, just as rejection of the gospel by some in Israel has led to a ministry
of salvation for non-Jews, so one day, in God's mercy, "all Israel"
will be saved (
⇒
 Romans 11:11-15,
⇒
 25-29, 
⇒
 30-32). The
fuller ethical response of believers is also drawn out, both with reference to
life in Christ's body (Rom 12) and with regard to the world
(
⇒
 Romans 13:1-7), on the basis of the
eschatological situation (
⇒
 Romans 13:11-14) and
conditions in the community (
⇒
14:1-
⇒
 15:13).
Others have viewed Romans
more in the light of Paul's earlier, quite polemical Letter to the Galatians
and so see the theme as the relationship between Judaism and Christianity, a topic
judged to be much in the minds of the Roman Christians. Each of these religious
faiths claimed to be the way of salvation based upon a covenant between God and
a people chosen and made the beneficiary of divine gifts. But Christianity
regarded itself as the prophetic development and fulfillment of the faith of
the Old Testament, declaring that the preparatory Mosaic covenant must now give
way to the new and more perfect covenant in Jesus Christ. Paul himself had been
the implacable advocate of freedom of Gentiles from the laws of the Mosaic
covenant and, especially in Galatia, had refused to allow attempts to impose
them on Gentile converts to the gospel. He had witnessed the personal
hostilities that developed between the adherents of the two faiths and had
written his strongly worded Letter to the Galatians against those Jewish
Christians who were seeking to persuade Gentile Christians to adopt the
religious practices of Judaism. For him, the purity of the religious
understanding of Jesus as the source of salvation would be seriously impaired
if Gentile Christians were obligated to amalgamate the two religious faiths.
Still others find the theme
of Israel and the church as expressed in Romans 9 - 11 to be the heart of
Romans. Then the implication of Paul's exposition of justification by faith
rather than by means of law is that the divine plan of salvation works itself
out on a broad theological plane to include the whole of humanity, despite the
differences in the content of the given religious system to which a human
culture is heir. Romans presents a plan of salvation stretching from Adam
through Abraham and Moses to Christ (Rom 4; 5) and on to the future revelation
at Christ's parousia (
⇒
 Romans 8:18-25). Its outlook
is universal.
Paul's Letter to the Romans
is a powerful exposition of the doctrine of the supremacy of Christ and of
faith in Christ as the source of salvation. It is an implicit plea to the
Christians at Rome, and to all Christians, to hold fast to that faith. They are
to resist any pressure put on them to accept a doctrine of salvation through
works of the law (see the note on 
⇒
 Romans 10:4). At
the same time they are not to exaggerate Christian freedom as an abdication of
responsibility for others (
⇒
 Romans 12:1-2) or as a
repudiation of God's law and will (see the notes on 
⇒
3:9-26; 
⇒
 3:31;
⇒
 7:7-12, 
⇒
 13-25).

2.     Humanity Lost without the Gospel
(
⇒

(
⇒

⇒
 8:39) 
5.     Jews and Gentiles in God's Plan (
⇒

6.     The Duties of Christians
(
⇒

7.     Conclusion
(
