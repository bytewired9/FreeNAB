[1]
 Therefore, you are without excuse, every one
of you who passes judgment. 
[2]
 For by the standard by which
you judge another you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, do the very same
things. 
2
We know that the judgment of God on those who
do such things is true. 
3
Do you suppose, then, you who judge those who
engage in such things and yet do them yourself, that you will escape the
judgment of God? 
4
Or do you hold his priceless kindness,
forbearance, and patience in low esteem, unaware that the kindness of God would
lead you to repentance? 
5
By your stubbornness and impenitent heart, you
are storing up wrath for yourself for the day of wrath and revelation of the
just judgment of God, 
6
who will repay everyone according to his works:
[3]
7
eternal life to those who seek glory, honor,
and immortality through perseverance in good works, 
8
but wrath and fury to those who selfishly
disobey the truth and obey wickedness. 
9
Yes, affliction and distress will come upon
every human being who does evil, Jew first and then Greek. 
10
But there will be glory, honor, and peace for
everyone who does good, Jew first and then Greek. 
11
[4]
 There is no partiality with God. 
12
[5]
 All who sin outside the law will also perish
without reference to it, and all who sin under the law will be judged in
accordance with it. 
13
For it is not those who hear the law who are
just in the sight of God; rather, those who observe the law will be justified. 
14
For when the Gentiles who do not have the law
by nature observe the prescriptions of the law, they are a law for themselves
even though they do not have the law. 
15
They show that the demands of the law are
written in their hearts, 
[6]
 while their conscience also bears
witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even defend them 
16
on the day when, according to my gospel, God
will judge people's hidden works through Christ Jesus. 
17
[7]
 Now if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the
law and boast of God 
18
and know his will and are able to discern what
is important since you are instructed from the law, 
19
and if you are confident that you are a guide
for the blind and a light for those in darkness, 
20
that you are a trainer of the foolish and
teacher of the simple, because in the law you have the formulation of knowledge
and truth -  
21
then you who teach another, are you failing to
teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal? 
22
You who forbid adultery, do you commit
adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob temples? 
23
You who boast of the law, do you dishonor God
by breaking the law? 
24
For, as it is written, "Because of you the
name of God is reviled among the Gentiles." 
[8]
25
Circumcision, to be sure, has value if you
observe the law; but if you break the law, your circumcision has become
uncircumcision. 
26
Again, if an uncircumcised man keeps the
precepts of the law, will he not be considered circumcised? 
27
Indeed, those who are physically uncircumcised
but carry out the law will pass judgment on you, with your written law and
circumcision, who break the law. 
28
One is not a Jew outwardly. True circumcision
is not outward, in the flesh. 
29
Rather, one is a Jew inwardly, and circumcision
is of the heart, in the spirit, not the letter; his praise is not from human
beings but from God.

 2:1-
⇒
 3:20]
After his general indictment of the Gentile, Paul shows that in spite of
special revelation Jews enjoy no advantage in moral status before God
(
⇒
 Romans 3:1-8). With the entire human race now
declared guilty before God (
⇒
 Romans 3:9-20), Paul
will then be able to display the solution for the total problem: salvation
through God's redemptive work that is revealed in Christ Jesus for all who
believe (
⇒
 Romans 3:21-31).
2
 [1-11] As a first step in his
demonstration that Jews enjoy no real moral supremacy over Gentiles, Paul
explains that the final judgment will be a review of performance, not of
privilege. From this perspective Gentiles stand on an equal footing with Jews,
and Jews cannot condemn the sins of Gentiles without condemning themselves. 
3
 [6] Will repay everyone according
to his works: Paul reproduces the Septuagint text of 
⇒
 Psalm
62:12 and 
⇒
 Proverb 24:12.
4
 [11] No partiality with God: this
sentence is not at variance with the statements in 
⇒
2:9-10. Since Jews are the first to go under indictment, it is only
fair that they be given first consideration in the distribution of blessings.
Basic, of course, is the understanding that God accepts no bribes
(
⇒
 Deut 10:17).
5
 [12-16] Jews cannot reasonably
demand from Gentiles the standard of conduct inculcated in the Old Testament
since God did not address its revelation to them. Rather, God made it possible
for Gentiles to know instinctively the difference between right and wrong. But,
as Paul explained in 
⇒
 Romans 1:18-32, humanity
misread the evidence of God's existence, power, and divinity, and "while
claiming to be wise, they became fools" (
⇒
1:22).
6
 [15] Paul expands on the thought of
⇒
 Jeremiah 31:33; 
⇒
 Wisdom
17:11.
7
 [17-29] Mere possession of laws is
no evidence of virtue. By eliminating circumcision as an elitist moral sign,
Paul clears away the last obstacle to his presentation of justification through
faith without claims based on the receipt of circumcision and its attendant
legal obligations.
8
 [24] According to
⇒
 Isaiah 52:5 the suffering of Israel prompts her
enemies to revile God. Paul uses the passage in support of his point that the
present immorality of Israelites is the cause of such defamation.
