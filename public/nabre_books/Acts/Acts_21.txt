[1]
 When we had taken leave of them we set sail,
made a straight run for Cos, and on the next day for Rhodes, and from there to
Patara. 
2
Finding a ship crossing to Phoenicia, we went
on board and put out to sea. 
3
We caught sight of Cyprus but passed by it on
our left and sailed on toward Syria and put in at Tyre where the ship was to
unload cargo. 
4
There we sought out the disciples and stayed
for a week. They kept telling Paul through the Spirit not to embark for
Jerusalem. 
5
At the end of our stay we left and resumed our
journey. All of them, women and children included, escorted us out of the city,
and after kneeling on the beach to pray, 
6
we bade farewell to one another. Then we
boarded the ship, and they returned home. 
7
We continued the voyage and came from Tyre to
Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and stayed a day with them. 
8
On the next day we resumed the trip and came to
Caesarea, where we went to the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of
the Seven, 
[2]
 and stayed with him. 
9
He had four virgin daughters gifted with
prophecy. 
10
We had been there several days when a prophet
named Agabus 
[3]
 came down from Judea. 
11
He came up to us, took Paul's belt, bound his
own feet and hands with it, and said, "Thus says the holy Spirit: This is
the way the Jews will bind the owner of this belt in Jerusalem, and they will
hand him over to the Gentiles." 
[4]
12
When we heard this, we and the local residents
begged him not to go up to Jerusalem. 
13
Then Paul replied, "What are you doing,
weeping and breaking my heart? I am prepared not only to be bound but even to
die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus." 
14
Since he would not be dissuaded we let the
matter rest, saying, "The Lord's will be done." 
[5]
15
After these days we made preparations for our
journey, then went up to Jerusalem. 
16
Some of the disciples from Caesarea came along
to lead us to the house of Mnason, a Cypriot, a disciple of long standing, with
whom we were to stay. 
17
[6]
 When we reached Jerusalem the brothers
welcomed us warmly. 
18
The next day, Paul accompanied us on a visit to
James, and all the presbyters were present. 
19
He greeted them, then proceeded to tell them in
detail what God had accomplished among the Gentiles through his ministry. 
20
They praised God when they heard it but said to
him, "Brother, you see how many thousands of believers there are from
among the Jews, and they are all zealous observers of the law. 
21
They have been informed that you are teaching
all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to abandon Moses and that you are
telling them not to circumcise their children or to observe their customary
practices. 
22
What is to be done? They will surely hear that
you have arrived. 
23
[7]
 So do what we tell you. We have four men who
have taken a vow. 
24
Take these men and purify yourself with them,
and pay their expenses 
[8]
 that they may have their heads
shaved. In this way everyone will know that there is nothing to the reports
they have been given about you but that you yourself live in observance of the
law. 
25
As for the Gentiles who have come to believe,
we sent them our decision that they abstain from meat sacrificed to idols, from
blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from unlawful marriage." 
[9]
26
So Paul took the men, and on the next day after
purifying himself together with them entered the temple to give notice of the
day when the purification would be completed and the offering made for each of
them. 
27
When the seven days were nearly completed, the
Jews from the province of Asia noticed him in the temple, stirred up the whole
crowd, and laid hands on him, 
28
shouting, "Fellow Israelites, help us.
This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the
law and this place, and what is more, he has even brought Greeks into the
temple and defiled this sacred place." 
[10]
29
For they had previously seen Trophimus the
Ephesian in the city with him and supposed that Paul had brought him into the
temple. 
30
The whole city was in turmoil with people
rushing together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and
immediately the gates were closed. 
31
While they were trying to kill him, a report
reached the cohort commander 
[11]
 that all Jerusalem was
rioting. 
32
He immediately took soldiers and centurions and
charged down on them. When they saw the commander and the soldiers they stopped
beating Paul. 
33
The cohort commander came forward, arrested
him, and ordered him to be secured with two chains; he tried to find out who he
might be and what he had done. 
34
Some in the mob shouted one thing, others
something else; so, since he was unable to ascertain the truth because of the
uproar, he ordered Paul to be brought into the compound. 
35
When he reached the steps, he was carried by
the soldiers because of the violence of the mob, 
36
[12]
 for a crowd of people followed and shouted,
"Away with him!" 
37
Just as Paul was about to be taken into the compound,
he said to the cohort commander, "May I say something to you?" He
replied, "Do you speak Greek? 
38
So then you are not the Egyptian 
[13]
who started a revolt some time ago and led the four thousand assassins into the
desert?" 
39
Paul answered, "I am a Jew, of Tarsus in
Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city; I request you to permit me to speak to the
people." 
40
When he had given his permission, Paul stood on
the steps and motioned with his hand to the people; and when all was quiet he
addressed them in Hebrew. 
[14]
1
 [1-18] The third
"we-section" of Acts (see the note on 
⇒
16:10-17). 
2
 [8] One of the Seven: see the note
on 
⇒
 Acts 6:2-4.
3
 [10] Agabus: mentioned in
⇒
 Acts 11:28 as the prophet who predicted the
famine that occurred when Claudius was emperor.
4
 [11] The symbolic act of Agabus
recalls those of Old Testament prophets. Compare 
⇒
 Isaiah
20:2; 
⇒
 Ezekiel 4:1;
⇒
 Jeremiah 13:1.
5
 [14] The Christian disciples'
attitude reflects that of Jesus (see 
⇒
 Luke 22:42).
6
 [17-26] The leaders of the Jewish
Christians of Jerusalem inform Paul that the Jews there believe he has
encouraged the Jews of the diaspora to abandon the Mosaic law. According to
Acts, Paul had no objection to the retention of the law by the Jewish
Christians of Jerusalem and left the Jews of the diaspora who accepted
Christianity free to follow the same practice.
7
 [23-26] The leaders of the
community suggest that Paul, on behalf of four members of the Jerusalem
community, make the customary payment for the sacrifices offered at the
termination of the Nazirite vow (see 
⇒
 Numbers
6:1-24) in order to impress favorably the Jewish Christians in
Jerusalem with his high regard for the Mosaic law. Since Paul himself had once
made this vow (
⇒
 Acts 18:18), his respect for the
law would be on public record.
8
 [24] Pay their expenses: according
to 
⇒
 Numbers 6:14-15 the Nazirite had to present a
yearling lamb for a holocaust, a yearling ewe lamb for a sin offering, and a
ram for a peace offering, along with food and drink offerings, upon completion
of the period of the vow.
9
 [25] Paul is informed about the
apostolic decree, seemingly for the first time (see the note on 
⇒
15:13-35). The allusion to the decree was probably introduced here by
Luke to remind his readers that the Gentile Christians themselves were asked to
respect certain Jewish practices deriving from the law.
10
 [28] The charges against Paul by
the diaspora Jews are identical to the charges brought against Stephen by
diaspora Jews in 
⇒
 Acts 6:13. Brought Greeks into
the temple: non-Jews were forbidden, under penalty of death, to go beyond the
Court of the Gentiles. Inscriptions in Greek and Latin on a stone balustrade
marked off the prohibited area.
11
 [31] Cohort commander: literally,
"the leader of a thousand in a cohort." At this period the Roman
cohort commander usually led six hundred soldiers, a tenth of a legion; but the
number in a cohort varied.
12
 [36] Away with him: at the trial of
Jesus before Pilate in 
⇒
 Luke 23:18, the people
similarly shout, "Away with this man."
13
 [38] The Egyptian: according to the
Jewish historian Josephus, an Egyptian gathered a large crowd on the Mount of
Olives to witness the destruction of the walls of Jerusalem that would fall at
the Egyptian "prophet's" word. The commotion was put down by the Roman
authorities and the Egyptian escaped, but only after thousands had been killed.
Four thousand assassins: literally, sicarii. According to Josephus, these were
political nationalists who removed their opponents by assassination with a
short dagger, called in Latin a sica.
14
 [40] In Hebrew: meaning, perhaps,
in Aramaic, which at this time was the Semitic tongue in common use.
