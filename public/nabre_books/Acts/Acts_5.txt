[1]
 A man named Ananias, however, with his wife
Sapphira, sold a piece of property. 
2
He retained for himself, with his wife's
knowledge, some of the purchase price, took the remainder, and put it at the
feet of the apostles. 
3
But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan
filled your heart so that you lied to the holy Spirit and retained part of the
price of the land? 
4
While it remained unsold, did it not remain
yours? And when it was sold, was it not still under your control? Why did you
contrive this deed? You have lied not to human beings, but to God." 
5
When Ananias heard these words, he fell down
and breathed his last, and great fear came upon all who heard of it. 
6
The young men came and wrapped him up, then
carried him out and buried him. 
7
After an interval of about three hours, his
wife came in, unaware of what had happened. 
8
Peter said to her, "Tell me, did you sell
the land for this amount?" She answered, "Yes, for that amount."
9
Then Peter said to her, "Why did you agree
to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen, the footsteps of those who have buried
your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out." 
10
At once, she fell down at his feet and breathed
her last. When the young men entered they found her dead, so they carried her
out and buried her beside her husband. 
11
And great fear came upon the whole church and
upon all who heard of these things. 
12
[2]
 Many signs and wonders were done among the
people at the hands of the apostles. They were all together in Solomon's
portico. 
13
None of the others dared to join them, but the
people esteemed them. 
14
Yet more than ever, believers in the Lord,
great numbers of men and women, were added to them. 
15
Thus they even carried the sick out into the
streets and laid them on cots and mats so that when Peter came by, at least his
shadow might fall on one or another of them. 
16
A large number of people from the towns in the
vicinity of Jerusalem also gathered, bringing the sick and those disturbed by
unclean spirits, and they were all cured. 
17
[3]
 Then the high priest rose up and all his
companions, that is, the party of the Sadducees, and, filled with jealousy, 
18
laid hands upon the apostles and put them in
the public jail. 
19
But during the night, the angel of the Lord
opened the doors of the prison, led them out, and said, 
20
"Go and take your place in the temple
area, and tell the people everything about this life." 
21
When they heard this, they went to the temple
early in the morning and taught. When the high priest and his companions
arrived, they convened the Sanhedrin, the full senate of the Israelites, and
sent to the jail to have them brought in. 
22
But the court officers who went did not find
them in the prison, so they came back and reported, 
23
"We found the jail securely locked and the
guards stationed outside the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one
inside." 
24
When they heard this report, the captain of the
temple guard and the chief priests were at a loss about them, as to what this
would come to. 
25
Then someone came in and reported to them,
"The men whom you put in prison are in the temple area and are teaching
the people." 
26
Then the captain and the court officers went
and brought them in, but without force, because they were afraid of being
stoned by the people. 
27
When they had brought them in and made them
stand before the Sanhedrin, the high priest questioned them, 
28
"We gave you strict orders (did we not?)
to stop teaching in that name. Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching
and want to bring this man's blood upon us." 
29
But Peter and the apostles said in reply,
"We must obey God rather than men. 
30
[4]
 The God of our ancestors raised Jesus, though
you had him killed by hanging him on a tree. 
31
God exalted him at his right hand 
[5]
as leader and savior to grant Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins. 
32
We are witnesses of these things, as is the
holy Spirit that God has given to those who obey him." 
33
When they heard this, they became infuriated
and wanted to put them to death. 
34
[6]
 But a Pharisee in the Sanhedrin named
Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, respected by all the people, stood up, ordered
the men to be put outside for a short time, 
35
and said to them, "Fellow Israelites, be
careful what you are about to do to these men. 
36
[7]
 Some time ago, Theudas appeared, claiming to
be someone important, and about four hundred men joined him, but he was killed,
and all those who were loyal to him were disbanded and came to nothing. 
37
After him came Judas the Galilean at the time
of the census. He also drew people after him, but he too perished and all who
were loyal to him were scattered. 
38
So now I tell you, have nothing to do with
these men, and let them go. For if this endeavor or this activity is of human
origin, it will destroy itself. 
39
But if it comes from God, you will not be able
to destroy them; you may even find yourselves fighting against God." They
were persuaded by him. 
40
After recalling the apostles, they had them
flogged, ordered them to stop speaking in the name of Jesus, and dismissed
them. 
41
So they left the presence of the Sanhedrin,
rejoicing that they had been found worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of
the name. 
42
And all day long, both at the temple and in
their homes, they did not stop teaching and proclaiming the Messiah, Jesus. 
1
 [1-11] The sin of Ananias and
Sapphira did not consist in the withholding of part of the money but in their
deception of the community. Their deaths are ascribed to a lie to the holy
Spirit (
⇒
 Acts 5:3, 9),
i.e., they accepted the honor accorded them by the community for their
generosity, but in reality they were not deserving of it. 
2
 [12-16] This, the third summary
portraying the Jerusalem community, underscores the Twelve as its bulwark,
especially because of their charismatic power to heal the sick; cf
⇒
 Acts 2:42-47;
⇒
 4:32-37.
3
 [17-42] A second action against the
community is taken by the Sanhedrin in the arrest and trial of the Twelve; cf 
⇒
4:1-3. The motive is the jealousy of the religious authorities over
the popularity of the apostles (
⇒
 Acts 5:17) who are
now charged with the defiance of the Sanhedrin's previous order to them to abandon
their prophetic role (
⇒
 Acts 5:28; cf
⇒
 Acts 4:18). In this crisis the apostles are
favored by a miraculous release from prison (
⇒
5:18-24). (For similar incidents involving Peter and Paul, see
⇒
 Acts 12:6-11;
⇒
 16:25-29.) The real significance of such an
event, however, would be manifest only to people of faith, not to unbelievers;
since the Sanhedrin already judged the Twelve to be inauthentic prophets, it
could disregard reports of their miracles. When the Twelve immediately resumed
public teaching, the Sanhedrin determined to invoke upon them the penalty of
death (
⇒
 Acts 5:33) prescribed in
⇒
 Deut 13:6-10. Gamaliel's advice against this
course finally prevailed, but it did not save the Twelve from the punishment of
scourging (
⇒
 Acts 5:40) in a last endeavor to shake
their conviction of their prophetic mission.
4
 [30] Hanging him on a tree: that
is, crucifying him (cf also 
⇒
 Gal 3:13).
5
 [31] At his right hand: see the
note on 
⇒
 Acts 2:33.
6
 [34] Gamaliel: in
⇒
 Acts 22:3, Paul identifies himself as a disciple
of this Rabbi Gamaliel I who flourished in Jerusalem between A.D. 25 and 50.
7
 [36-37] Gamaliel offers examples of
unsuccessful contemporary movements to argue that if God is not the origin of
this movement preached by the apostles it will perish by itself. The movement
initiated by Theudas actually occurred when C. Cuspius Fadus was governor, A.D.
44-46. Luke's placing of Judas the Galilean after Theudas and at the time of
the census (see the note on 
⇒
 Luke 2:1-2) is an
indication of the vagueness of his knowledge of these events.
