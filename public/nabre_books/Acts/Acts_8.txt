Now Saul was consenting to his execution.On
that day, there broke out a severe persecution 
[1]
 of the
church in Jerusalem, and all were scattered throughout the countryside of Judea
and Samaria, except the apostles. 
[2]
2
Devout men buried Stephen and made a loud
lament over him. 
3
Saul, meanwhile, was trying to destroy the
church; 
[3]
 entering house after house and dragging out men
and women, he handed them over for imprisonment. 
4
Now those who had been scattered went about
preaching the word. 
5
Thus Philip went down to (the) city of Samaria
and proclaimed the Messiah to them. 
6
With one accord, the crowds paid attention to
what was said by Philip when they heard it and saw the signs he was doing. 
7
For unclean spirits, crying out in a loud
voice, came out of many possessed people, and many paralyzed and crippled
people were cured. 
8
There was great joy in that city. 
9
A man named Simon used to practice magic 
[4]
in the city and astounded the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great. 
10
All of them, from the least to the greatest,
paid attention to him, saying, "This man is the 'Power of God' that is
called 'Great.'" 
11
They paid attention to him because he had
astounded them by his magic for a long time, 
12
but once they began to believe Philip as he
preached the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ,
men and women alike were baptized. 
13
Even Simon himself believed and, after being
baptized, became devoted to Philip; and when he saw the signs and mighty deeds
that were occurring, he was astounded. 
14
Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that
Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent them Peter and John, 
15
who went down and prayed for them, that they
might receive the holy Spirit, 
16
for it had not yet fallen upon any of them;
they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
[5]
17
Then they laid hands on them and they received
the holy Spirit. 
18
[6]
 When Simon saw that the Spirit was conferred
by the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money 
19
and said, "Give me this power too, so that
anyone upon whom I lay my hands may receive the holy Spirit." 
20
But Peter said to him, "May your money
perish with you, because you thought that you could buy the gift of God with
money. 
21
You have no share or lot in this matter, for
your heart is not upright before God. 
22
Repent of this wickedness of yours and pray to
the Lord that, if possible, your intention may be forgiven. 
23
For I see that you are filled with bitter gall
and are in the bonds of iniquity." 
24
Simon said in reply, "Pray for me to the
Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me." 
25
So when they had testified and proclaimed the word
of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem and preached the good news to many
Samaritan villages. 
26
[7]
 Then the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip,
"Get up and head south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza,
the desert route." 
27
So he got up and set out. Now there was an
Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of the Candace, 
[8]
 that
is, the queen of the Ethiopians, in charge of her entire treasury, who had come
to Jerusalem to worship, 
28
and was returning home. Seated in his chariot,
he was reading the prophet Isaiah. 
29
The Spirit said to Philip, "Go and join up
with that chariot." 
30
[9]
 Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the
prophet and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?" 
31
He replied, "How can I, unless someone
instructs me?" So he invited Philip to get in and sit with him. 
32
This was the scripture passage he was reading:
"Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its
shearer is silent, so he opened not his mouth. 
33
In (his) humiliation justice was denied him.
Who will tell of his posterity? For his life is taken from the earth." 
34
Then the eunuch said to Philip in reply,
"I beg you, about whom is the prophet saying this? About himself, or about
someone else?" 
35
Then Philip opened his mouth and, beginning
with this scripture passage, he proclaimed Jesus to him. 
36
As they traveled along the road they came to
some water, and the eunuch said, "Look, there is water. What is to prevent
my being baptized?" 
37
[10]
38
Then he ordered the chariot to stop, and Philip
and the eunuch both went down into the water, and he baptized him. 
39
When they came out of the water, the Spirit of
the Lord snatched Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, but continued on
his way rejoicing. 
40
Philip came to Azotus, and went about
proclaiming the good news to all the towns until he reached Caesarea. 
1
 [1-40] Some idea of the severity of
the persecution that now breaks out against the Jerusalem community can be
gathered from 
⇒
 Acts 22:4 and
⇒
 Acts 26:9-11. Luke, however, concentrates on the
fortunes of the word of God among people, indicating how the dispersal of the
Jewish community resulted in the conversion of the Samaritans
(
⇒
 Acts 8:4-17, 
⇒
 25). His
narrative is further expanded to include the account of Philip's acceptance of
an Ethiopian (
⇒
 Acts 8:26-39).
2
 [1] All were scattered . . . except
the apostles: this observation leads some modern scholars to conclude that the
persecution was limited to the Hellenist Christians and that the Hebrew Christians
were not molested, perhaps because their attitude toward the law and temple was
still more in line with that of their fellow Jews (see the charge leveled
against the Hellenist Stephen in Acts 6, 13-14). Whatever the facts, it appears
that the Twelve took no public stand regarding Stephen's position, choosing,
instead, to await the development of events. 
3
 [3] Saul . . . was trying to
destroy the church: like Stephen, Saul was able to perceive that the Christian
movement contained the seeds of doctrinal divergence from Judaism. A pupil of
Gamaliel, according to 
⇒
 Acts 22:3, and totally
dedicated to the law as the way of salvation (
⇒
 Gal
1:13-14), Saul accepted the task of crushing the Christian movement,
at least insofar as it detracted from the importance of the temple and the law.
His vehement opposition to Christianity reveals how difficult it was for a Jew
of his time to accept a messianism that differed so greatly from the general expectation.
4
 [9-13,18-24] Sorcerers were well
known in the ancient world. Probably the incident involving Simon and his
altercation with Peter is introduced to show that the miraculous charisms
possessed by members of the Christian community (
⇒
8:6-7) were not to be confused with the magic of sorcerers.
5
 [16] Here and in
⇒
 Acts 10:44-48 and 
⇒
19:1-6, Luke distinguishes between baptism in the name of the Lord
Jesus and the reception of the Spirit. In each case, the Spirit is conferred
through members of the Twelve (Peter and John) or their representative (Paul).
This may be Luke's way of describing the role of the church in the bestowal of
the Spirit. Elsewhere in Acts, baptism and the Spirit are more closely related
(
⇒
 Acts 1:5; 
⇒
 11:16).
6
 [18-20] Simon attempts to buy the
gift of God (
⇒
 Acts 8:20) with money. Peter's
cursing of Simon's attempt so to use his money expresses a typically Lucan
attitude toward material wealth (cf 
⇒
 Luke 6:24;
⇒
 12:16-21; 
⇒
 16:13).
7
 [26-40] In the account of the
conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch, Luke adduces additional evidence to show
that the spread of Christianity outside the confines of Judaism itself was in
accord with the plan of God. He does not make clear whether the Ethiopian was
originally a convert to Judaism or, as is more probable, a
"God-fearer" (
⇒
 Acts 10:1), i.e., one who
accepted Jewish monotheism and ethic and attended the synagogue but did not
consider himself bound by other regulations such as circumcision and observance
of the dietary laws. The story of his conversion to Christianity is given a
strong supernatural cast by the introduction of an angel
(
⇒
 Acts 8:26), instruction from the holy Spirit
(
⇒
 Acts 8:29), and the strange removal of Philip
from the scene (39).
8
 [27] The Candace: Candace is not a
proper name here but the title of a Nubian queen.
9
 [30-34] Philip is brought alongside
the carriage at the very moment when the Ethiopian is pondering the meaning of
⇒
 Isaiah 53:7-8, a passage that Christianity, from
its earliest origins, has applied to Jesus; cf the note on
⇒
 Acts 3:13.
10
 [37] The oldest and best
manuscripts of Acts omit this verse, which is a Western text reading: "And
Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may.' And he said in
reply, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.' "
