After this he left Athens and went to Corinth. 
2
There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of
Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla 
[1]
because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. He went to visit them 
3
and, because he practiced the same trade,
stayed with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade. 
4
Every sabbath, he entered into discussions in
the synagogue, attempting to convince both Jews and Greeks. 
5
When Silas and Timothy came down from
Macedonia, Paul began to occupy himself totally with preaching the word,
testifying to the Jews that the Messiah was Jesus. 
6
When they opposed him and reviled him, he shook
out his garments 
[2]
 and said to them, "Your blood be on
your heads! I am clear of responsibility. From now on I will go to the
Gentiles." 
7
So he left there and went to a house belonging
to a man named Titus Justus, a worshiper of God; 
[3]
 his house
was next to a synagogue. 
8
Crispus, 
[4]
 the synagogue
official, came to believe in the Lord along with his entire household, and many
of the Corinthians who heard believed and were baptized. 
9
One night in a vision the Lord said to Paul,
"Do not be afraid. Go on speaking, and do not be silent, 
10
for I am with you. No one will attack and harm
you, for I have many people in this city." 
11
He settled there for a year and a half and
taught the word of God among them. 
12
But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, 
[5]
the Jews rose up together against Paul and brought him to the tribunal, 
13
saying, "This man is inducing people to
worship God contrary to the law." 
[6]
14
When Paul was about to reply, Gallio spoke to
the Jews, "If it were a matter of some crime or malicious fraud, I should
with reason hear the complaint of you Jews; 
15
but since it is a question of arguments over
doctrine and titles and your own law, see to it yourselves. I do not wish to be
a judge of such matters." 
16
And he drove them away from the tribunal. 
17
They all seized Sosthenes, the synagogue
official, and beat him in full view of the tribunal. But none of this was of
concern to Gallio. 
18
Paul remained for quite some time, and after
saying farewell to the brothers he sailed for Syria, together with Priscilla
and Aquila. At Cenchreae he had his hair cut because he had taken a vow. 
[7]
19
When they reached Ephesus, he left them there,
while he entered the synagogue and held discussions with the Jews. 
20
Although they asked him to stay for a longer
time, he did not consent, 
21
but as he said farewell he promised, "I
shall come back to you again, God willing." Then he set sail from Ephesus.
22
Upon landing at Caesarea, he went up and
greeted the church 
[8]
 and then went down to Antioch. 
23
[9]
 After staying there some time, he left and traveled
in orderly sequence through the Galatian country and Phrygia, bringing strength
to all the disciples. 
24
A Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an
eloquent speaker, arrived in Ephesus. He was an authority on the scriptures. 
[10]
25
He had been instructed in the Way of the Lord
and, with ardent spirit, spoke and taught accurately about Jesus, although he
knew only the baptism of John. 
26
He began to speak boldly in the synagogue; but
when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him
the Way (of God) 
[11]
 more accurately. 
27
And when he wanted to cross to Achaia, the
brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. After
his arrival he gave great assistance to those who had come to believe through
grace. 
28
He vigorously refuted the Jews in public,
establishing from the scriptures that the Messiah is Jesus.

 [2] Aquila . . . Priscilla: both may already have been
Christians at the time of their arrival in Corinth (see
⇒
 Acts 18:26). According to 
⇒
 1
Cor 16:19, their home became a meeting place for Christians.
Claudius: the Emperor Claudius expelled the Jews from Rome ca. A.D. 40. The
Roman historian Suetonius gives as reason for the expulsion disturbances among
the Jews "at the instigation of Chrestos," probably meaning disputes
about the messiahship of Jesus.

 [6] Shook out his garments: a
gesture indicating Paul's repudiation of his mission to the Jews there; cf
⇒
 Acts 28:17-31.

note on

 Acts 8:26-40.

 [8] Crispus: in
⇒
 1 Cor 1:14 Paul mentions that Crispus was one of
the few he himself baptized at Corinth.
5
 [12] When Gallio was proconsul of
Achaia: Gallio's proconsulship in Achaia is dated to A.D. 51-52 from an
inscription discovered at Delphi. This has become an important date in
establishing a chronology of the life and missionary work of Paul.
6
 [13] Contrary to the law: Gallio
(
⇒
 Acts 18:15) understands this to be a problem of
Jewish, not Roman, law.
7
 [18] He had his hair cut because he
had taken a vow: a reference to a Nazirite vow (see 
⇒
 Numbers
6:1-21, especially, 
⇒
 6:18) taken by Paul
(see also 
⇒
 Acts 21:23-27).
8
 [22] He went up and greeted the
church: "going up" suggests a visit to the church in Jerusalem.

Luke's account of Paul's third missionary journey devotes itself mainly to his
work at Ephesus (
⇒
19:1-
⇒
 20:1). There is a certain
restiveness on Paul's part and a growing conviction that the Spirit bids him
return to Jerusalem and prepare to go to Rome (
⇒
19:21).
10
 [24,25] Apollos appears as a
preacher who knows the teaching of Jesus in the context of John's baptism of
repentance. Aquila and Priscilla instruct him more fully. He is referred to in
⇒
 1 Cor 1:12; 
⇒
 3:5-6,
⇒
 22.
