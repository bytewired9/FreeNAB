[1]
 About that time King Herod laid hands upon
some members of the church to harm them. 
2
He had James, the brother of John, 
[2]
killed by the sword, 
3
[3]
 and when he saw that this was pleasing to the
Jews he proceeded to arrest Peter also. (It was (the) feast of Unleavened
Bread.) 
4
He had him taken into custody and put in prison
under the guard of four squads of four soldiers each. He intended to bring him
before the people after Passover. 
5
Peter thus was being kept in prison, but prayer
by the church was fervently being made to God on his behalf. 
6
On the very night before Herod was to bring him
to trial, Peter, secured by double chains, was sleeping between two soldiers,
while outside the door guards kept watch on the prison. 
7
Suddenly the angel of the Lord stood by him and
a light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on the side and awakened him,
saying, "Get up quickly." The chains fell from his wrists. 
8
The angel said to him, "Put on your belt
and your sandals." He did so. Then he said to him, "Put on your cloak
and follow me." 
9
So he followed him out, not realizing that what
was happening through the angel was real; he thought he was seeing a vision. 
10
They passed the first guard, then the second,
and came to the iron gate leading out to the city, which opened for them by
itself. They emerged and made their way down an alley, and suddenly the angel
left him. 
11
Then Peter recovered his senses and said,
"Now I know for certain that (the) Lord sent his angel and rescued me from
the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people had been expecting."
12
When he realized this, he went to the house of
Mary, the mother of John who is called Mark, where there were many people
gathered in prayer. 
13
When he knocked on the gateway door, a maid
named Rhoda came to answer it. 
14
She was so overjoyed when she recognized
Peter's voice that, instead of opening the gate, she ran in and announced that
Peter was standing at the gate. 
15
They told her, "You are out of your
mind," but she insisted that it was so. But they kept saying, "It is
his angel." 
16
But Peter continued to knock, and when they
opened it, they saw him and were astounded. 
17
He motioned to them with his hand to be quiet
and explained (to them) how the Lord had led him out of the prison, and said,
"Report this to James 
[4]
 and the brothers." Then he
left and went to another place. 
18
At daybreak there was no small commotion among
the soldiers over what had become of Peter. 
19
Herod, after instituting a search but not
finding him, ordered the guards tried and executed. Then he left Judea to spend
some time in Caesarea. 
20
[5]
 He had long been very angry with the people of
Tyre and Sidon, who now came to him in a body. After winning over Blastus, the
king's chamberlain, they sued for peace because their country was supplied with
food from the king's territory. 
21
On an appointed day, Herod, attired in royal
robes, (and) seated on the rostrum, addressed them publicly. 
22
The assembled crowd cried out, "This is
the voice of a god, not of a man." 
23
At once the angel of the Lord struck him down
because he did not ascribe the honor to God, and he was eaten by worms and
breathed his last. 
24
But the word of God continued to spread and
grow. 
25
After Barnabas and Saul completed their relief
mission, they returned to Jerusalem, 
[6]
 taking with them
John, who is called Mark. 
1
 [1-19] Herod Agrippa ruled Judea
A.D. 41-44. While Luke does not assign a motive for his execution of James and
his intended execution of Peter, the broad background lies in Herod's support
of Pharisaic Judaism. The Jewish Christians had lost the popularity they had
had in Jerusalem (
⇒
 Acts 2:47), perhaps because of
suspicions against them traceable to the teaching of Stephen. 
2
 [2] James, the brother of John:
this James, the son of Zebedee, was beheaded by Herod Agrippa ca. A.D. 44.
3
 [3,4] Feast of Unleavened Bread . .
. Passover: see the note on Luke 22:1.
4
 [17] To James: this James is not
the son of Zebedee mentioned in 
⇒
 Acts 12:2, but is
James, the "brother of the Lord" (
⇒
 Gal
1:19), who in Acts 15; 21 is presented as leader of the Jerusalem
Christian community. He left and went to another place: the conjecture that
Peter left for Rome at this time has nothing to recommend it. His chief
responsibility was still the leadership of the Jewish Christian community in
Palestine (see 
⇒
 Gal 2:7). The concept of the great
missionary effort of the church was yet to come (see 
⇒
13:1-3).
5
 [20-23] Josephus gives a similar
account of Herod's death that occurred in A.D. 44. Early Christian tradition
considered the manner of it to be a divine punishment upon his evil life. See
⇒
 2 Kings 19:35 for the figure of the angel of the
Lord in such a context.
6
 [25] They returned to Jerusalem:
many manuscripts read "from Jerusalem," since
⇒
 Acts 11:30 implies that Paul and Barnabas are
already in Jerusalem. This present verse could refer to a return visit or
subsequent relief mission.
