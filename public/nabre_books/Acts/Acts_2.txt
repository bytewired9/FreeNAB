[1]
 When the time for Pentecost was fulfilled,
they were all in one place together. 
2
And suddenly there came from the sky a noise
like a strong driving wind, 
[2]
 and it filled the entire house
in which they were. 
3
Then there appeared to them tongues as of fire,
[3]
 which parted and came to rest on each one of them. 
4
And they were all filled with the holy Spirit
and began to speak in different tongues, 
[4]
 as the Spirit
enabled them to proclaim. 
5
Now there were devout Jews from every nation
under heaven staying in Jerusalem. 
6
At this sound, they gathered in a large crowd,
but they were confused because each one heard them speaking in his own
language. 
7
They were astounded, and in amazement they
asked, "Are not all these people who are speaking Galileans? 
8
Then how does each of us hear them in his own
native language? 
9
We are Parthians, Medes, and Elamites,
inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, 
10
Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts
of Libya near Cyrene, as well as travelers from Rome, 
11
both Jews and converts to Judaism, Cretans and
Arabs, yet we hear them speaking in our own tongues of the mighty acts of
God." 
12
They were all astounded and bewildered, and
said to one another, "What does this mean?" 
13
But others said, scoffing, "They have had
too much new wine." 
14
[5]
 Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised
his voice, and proclaimed to them, "You who are Jews, indeed all of you
staying in Jerusalem. Let this be known to you, and listen to my words. 
15
These people are not drunk, as you suppose, for
it is only nine o'clock in the morning. 
16
No, this is what was spoken through the prophet
Joel: 
17
'It will come to pass in the last days,' God
says, 'that I will pour out a portion of my spirit upon all flesh. Your sons
and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, your old
men shall dream dreams. 
18
Indeed, upon my servants and my handmaids I
will pour out a portion of my spirit in those days, and they shall prophesy. 
19
And I will work wonders in the heavens above
and signs on the earth below: blood, fire, and a cloud of smoke. 
20
The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon
to blood, before the coming of the great and splendid day of the Lord, 
21
and it shall be that everyone shall be saved
who calls on the name of the Lord.' 
22
You who are Israelites, hear these words. Jesus
the Nazorean was a man commended to you by God with mighty deeds, wonders, and
signs, which God worked through him in your midst, as you yourselves know. 
23
This man, delivered up by the set plan and
foreknowledge of God, you killed, using lawless men to crucify him. 
24
But God raised him up, releasing him from the
throes of death, because it was impossible for him to be held by it. 
25
For David says of him: 'I saw the Lord ever
before me, with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed. 
26
Therefore my heart has been glad and my tongue
has exulted; my flesh, too, will dwell in hope, 
27
because you will not abandon my soul to the
netherworld, nor will you suffer your holy one to see corruption. 
28
You have made known to me the paths of life;
you will fill me with joy in your presence.' 
29
My brothers, one can confidently say to you
about the patriarch David that he died and was buried, and his tomb is in our
midst to this day. 
30
But since he was a prophet and knew that God
had sworn an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants upon his
throne, 
31
he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of the
Messiah, that neither was he abandoned to the netherworld nor did his flesh see
corruption. 
32
God raised this Jesus; of this we are all
witnesses. 
33
Exalted at the right hand of God, 
[6]
he received the promise of the holy Spirit from the Father and poured it forth,
as you (both) see and hear. 
34
For David did not go up into heaven, but he
himself said: 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand 
35
until I make your enemies your
footstool."' 
36
Therefore let the whole house of Israel know
for certain that God has made him both Lord and Messiah, this Jesus whom you
crucified." 
37
Now when they heard this, they were cut to the
heart, and they asked Peter and the other apostles, "What are we to do, my
brothers?" 
38
Peter (said) to them, "Repent and be
baptized, 
[7]
 every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ
for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the holy
Spirit. 
39
For the promise is made to you and to your
children and to all those far off, whomever the Lord our God will call." 
40
He testified with many other arguments, and was
exhorting them, "Save yourselves from this corrupt generation." 
41
Those who accepted his message were baptized,
and about three thousand persons were added that day. 
42
[8]
 They devoted themselves to the teaching of the
apostles and to the communal life, to the breaking of the bread and to the
prayers. 
43
Awe came upon everyone, and many wonders and
signs were done through the apostles. 
44
All who believed were together and had all
things in common; 
45
they would sell their property and possessions
and divide them among all according to each one's need. 
46
Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together
in the temple area and to breaking bread in their homes. They ate their meals
with exultation and sincerity of heart, 
47
praising God and enjoying favor with all the people.
And every day the Lord added to their number those who were being saved. 
1
 [1-41] Luke's pentecostal narrative
consists of an introduction (
⇒
 Acts 2:1-13), a speech
ascribed to Peter declaring the resurrection of Jesus and its messianic significance
(
⇒
 Acts 2:14-36), and a favorable response from the
audience (
⇒
 Acts 2:37-41). It is likely that the
narrative telescopes events that took place over a period of time and on a less
dramatic scale. The Twelve were not originally in a position to proclaim
publicly the messianic office of Jesus without incurring immediate reprisal
from those religious authorities in Jerusalem who had brought about Jesus'
death precisely to stem the rising tide in his favor. 
2
 [2] There came from the sky a noise
like a strong driving wind: wind and spirit are associated in
⇒
 John 3:8. The sound of a great rush of wind would
herald a new action of God in the history of salvation.
3
 [3] Tongues as of fire: see
⇒
 Exodus 19:18 where fire symbolizes the presence
of God to initiate the covenant on Sinai. Here the holy Spirit acts upon the
apostles, preparing them to proclaim the new covenant with its unique gift of
the Spirit (
⇒
 Acts 2:38).
4
 [4] To speak in different tongues:
ecstatic prayer in praise of God, interpreted in 
⇒
2:6, 
⇒
 11 as speaking in foreign
languages, symbolizing the worldwide mission of the church.
5
 [14-36] The first of six discourses
in Acts (along with 
⇒
 Acts 3:12-26;
⇒
 4:8-12; 
⇒
 5:29-32; 
⇒
 10:34-43;
⇒
 13:16-41) dealing with the resurrection of Jesus
and its messianic import. Five of these are attributed to Peter, the final one
to Paul. Modern scholars term these discourses in Acts the "kerygma,"
the Greek word for proclamation (cf 
⇒
 1 Cor
15:11).
6
 [33] At the right hand of God: or
"by the right hand of God."
7
 [38] Repent and be baptized:
repentance is a positive concept, a change of mind and heart toward God
reflected in the actual goodness of one's life. It is in accord with the
apostolic teaching derived from Jesus (
⇒
 Acts 2:42)
and ultimately recorded in the four gospels. Luke presents baptism in Acts as
the expected response to the apostolic preaching about Jesus and associates it
with the conferring of the Spirit (
⇒
 Acts 1:5;
⇒
 10:44-48; 
⇒
 11:16).
8
 [42-47] The first of three summary
passages (along with 
⇒
 Acts 4:32-37;
⇒
 5:12-16) that outline, somewhat idyllically, the
chief characteristics of the Jerusalem community: adherence to the teachings of
the Twelve and the centering of its religious life in the eucharistic liturgy
(
⇒
 Acts 2:42); a system of distribution of goods
that led wealthier Christians to sell their possessions when the needs of the
community's poor required it (
⇒
 Acts 2:44 and the
note on 
⇒
 Acts 4:32-37); and continued attendance at
the temple, since in this initial stage there was little or no thought of any
dividing line between Christianity and Judaism (
⇒
2:46).
