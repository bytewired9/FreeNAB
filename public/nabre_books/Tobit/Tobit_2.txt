 Thus under King Esarhaddon I returned to my
home, and my wife Anna and my son Tobiah were restored to me. Then on our
festival of Pentecost, the feast of Weeks, a fine dinner was prepared for me,
and I reclined to eat. 
2
[2]
 The table was set for me, and when many
different dishes were placed before me, I said to my son Tobiah: "My son,
go out and try to find a poor man from among our kinsmen exiled here in
Nineveh. If he is a sincere worshiper of God, bring him back with you, so that
he can share this meal with me. Indeed, son, I shall wait for you to come
back." 
3
Tobiah went out to look for some poor kinsman
of ours. When he returned he exclaimed, "Father!" I said to him,
"What is it, son?" He answered, "Father, one of our people has
been murdered! His body lies in the market place where he was just
strangled!" 
4
I sprang to my feet, leaving the dinner
untouched; and I carried the dead man from the street and put him in one of the
rooms, so that I might bury him after sunset. 
5
[3]
 Returning to my own quarters, I washed myself
and ate my food in sorrow. 
6
I was reminded of the oracle pronounced by the
prophet Amos against Bethel: "Your festivals shall be turned into
mourning, And all your songs into lamentation." 
7
And I wept. Then at sunset I went out, dug a
grave, and buried him. 
8
The neighbors mocked me, saying to one another:
"Will this man never learn! Once before he was hunted down for execution
because of this very thing; yet now that he has escaped, here he is again
burying the dead!" 
9
That same night I bathed, and went to sleep
next to the wall of my courtyard. Because of the heat I left my face uncovered.
10
[4]
 I did not know there were birds perched on the
wall above me, till their warm droppings settled in my eyes, causing cataracts.
I went to see some doctors for a cure, but the more they anointed my eyes with
various salves, the worse the cataracts became, until I could see no more. For
four years I was deprived of eyesight, and all my kinsmen were grieved at my
condition. Ahiqar, however, took care of me for two years, until he left for
Elymais. 
11
At that time my wife Anna worked for hire at
weaving cloth, the kind of work women do. 
12
[5]
 When she sent back the goods to their owners,
they would pay her. Late in winter she finished the cloth and sent it back to
the owners. They paid her the full salary, and also gave her a young goat for
the table. 
13
On entering my house the goat began to bleat. I
called to my wife and said: "Where did this goat come from? Perhaps it was
stolen! Give it back to its owners; we have no right to eat stolen food!" 
14
[6]
 But she said to me, "It was given to me
as a bonus over and above my wages." Yet I would not believe her, and told
her to give it back to its owners. I became very angry with her over this. So
she retorted: "Where are your charitable deeds now? Where are your
virtuous acts? See! Your true character is finally showing itself!"

by its Greek name Pentecost, was celebrated fifty days after the Passover. Cf

are important virtues taught by the book (

 [5] I washed myself: because of
ritual defilement from touching a corpse (

 [10] Cataracts: literally,
"white scales, or films." Elymais: the Greek name of ancient Elam, a
district northeast of the head of the Persian Gulf.

 [12] Late in winter: literally,
"seventh of Dystros," the Macedonian month which corresponds to the
Jewish month of Shebat (January-February). For the table: literally, "for
the hearth"; the gift had probably been made in view of some springtime
festival like the Jewish Purim.

mind the words of Job's wife (

 Job 2:9).
