Grief-stricken in spirit, I groaned and wept
aloud. Then with sobs I began to pray: 
2
"You are righteous, O Lord, and all your
deeds are just; All your ways are mercy and truth; you are the judge of the
world. 
3
And now, O Lord, may you be mindful of me, and
look with favor upon me. Punish me not for my sins, nor for my inadvertent
offenses, nor for those of my fathers. "They sinned against you, 
4
and disobeyed your commandments. So you handed
us over to plundering, exile, and death, till we were an object lesson, a
byword, a reproach in all the nations among whom you scattered us. 
5
"Yes, your judgments are many and true in
dealing with me as my sins and those of my fathers deserve. For we have not
kept your commandments, nor have we trodden the paths of truth before you. 
6
[1]
 "So now, deal with me as you please, and
command my life breath to be taken from me, that I may go from the face of the
earth into dust. It is better for me to die than to live, because I have heard
insulting calumnies, and I am overwhelmed with grief. "Lord, command me to
be delivered from such anguish; let me go to the everlasting abode; Lord,
refuse me not. For it is better for me to die than to endure so much misery in
life, and to hear these insults!" 
7
[2]
 On the same day, at Ecbatana in Media, it so
happened that Raguel's daughter Sarah also had to listen to abuse, from one of
her father's maids. 
8
[3]
 For she had been married to seven husbands,
but the wicked demon Asmodeus killed them off before they could have
intercourse with her, as it is prescribed for wives. So the maid said to her:
"You are the one who strangles your husbands! Look at you! You have
already been married seven times, but you have had no joy with any one of your
husbands. 
9
Why do you beat us? Because your husbands are
dead? Then why not join them! May we never see a son or daughter of
yours!" 
10
That day she was deeply grieved in spirit. She
went in tears to an upstairs room in her father's house with the intention of
hanging herself. But she reconsidered, saying to herself: "No! People
would level this insult against my father: 'You had only one beloved daughter,
but she hanged herself because of ill fortune!' And thus would I cause my
father in his old age to go down to the nether world laden with sorrow. It is
far better for me not to hang myself, but to beg the Lord to have me die, so
that I need no longer live to hear such insults." 
11
[4]
 At that time, then, she spread out her hands,
and facing the window, poured out this prayer: "Blessed are you, O Lord,
merciful God! Forever blessed and honored is your holy name; may all your works
forever bless you. 
12
And now, O Lord, to you I turn my face and
raise my eyes. 
13
Bid me to depart from the earth, never again to
hear such insults. 
14
"You know, O Master, that I am innocent of
any impure act with a man, 
15
And that I have never defiled my own name or my
father's name in the land of my exile. "I am my father's only daughter,
and he has no other child to make his heir, Nor does he have a close kinsman or
other relative whom I might bide my time to marry. I have already lost seven
husbands; why then should I live any longer? But if it please you, Lord, not to
slay me, look favorably upon me and have pity on me; never again let me hear
these insults!" 
16
At that very time, the prayer of these two
suppliants was heard in the glorious presence of Almighty God. 
17
[5]
 So Raphael was sent to heal them both: to
remove the cataracts from Tobit's eyes, so that he might again see God's
sunlight; and to marry Raguel's daughter Sarah to Tobit's son Tobiah, and then
drive the wicked demon Asmodeus from her. For Tobiah had the right to claim her
before any other who might wish to marry her.In the very moment that Tobit
returned from the courtyard to his house, Raguel's daughter Sarah came
downstairs from her room.

 [6] It is better for me to die than
to live: in his distress Tobit uses the words of the petulant Jonah
(
⇒
 Jonah 4:3, 8), who
wished to die because God did not destroy the hated Ninevites. In similar
circumstances, Moses (
⇒
 Numbers 11:15), Elijah
(
⇒
 1 Kings 19:4), and Job (
⇒
 Job
7:15) also prayed for death. Everlasting abode: a reference to Sheol,
the dismal abode of the dead from which no one returns (
⇒
 Job
7:9-10; 
⇒
 14:12; 
⇒
 Isaiah
26:14). The revelation of a blessed immortality had not yet been
made. See note on 
⇒
 Tobit 4:6. 
2
 [7] From here on, the story is told
in the third person. 
⇒
 Tobit 3:7 relates one of the
several marvelous coincidences which the story teller uses to heighten
interest; see also 
⇒
 Tobit 3:16,

 17;

 4:1;

 5:4. Ecbatana: Hamadan in modern Iran; this was the
capital of ancient Media. Raguel: "friend of God."

 [8] Asmodeus: in Persian aeshma
daeva, "demon of wrath," adopted into Aramaic with the sense of
"the Destroyer." He will be subdued (
⇒
 Tobit 8:3)
by Raphael (
⇒
 Tobit 3:17) "God heals."
4
 [11] Facing the window: that is,
looking toward Jerusalem; cf 
⇒
 Daniel 6:11: Blessed
are you and "Blessed be God" are traditional openings of Jewish
prayers (
⇒
 Tobit 8:5,
⇒
 15; 
⇒
 11:14;
⇒
 13:1).

 [17] Tobiah had the right:
according to the patriarchal custom of marriage within the family group. Tobiah
was Sarah's closest eligible relative (
⇒
6:12). Cf 
⇒
 Tobit 4:12-13; Genesis 24.
