After this, David defeated the Philistines and
subdued them; and he took Gath and its towns away from the control of the
Philistines. 
2
He also defeated Moab, and the Moabites became
his subjects, paying tribute. 
3
David then defeated Hadadezer, king of Zobah
toward Hamath, when the latter was on his way to set up his victory stele at
the river Euphrates. 
4
David took from him twenty thousand foot
soldiers, one thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen. Of the chariot
horses, David hamstrung all but one hundred. 
5
The Arameans of Damascus came to the aid of
Hadadezer, king of Zobah, but David also slew twenty-two thousand of their men.
6
Then David set up garrisons in the Damascus
region of Aram, and the Arameans became his subjects, paying tribute. Thus the
LORD made David victorious in all his campaigns. 
7
David took the golden shields that were carried
by Hadadezer's attendants and brought them to Jerusalem. 
8
He likewise took away from Tibhath and Cun,
cities of Hadadezer, large quantities of bronze, which Solomon later used to
make the bronze sea and the pillars and the vessels of bronze. 
9
When Tou, king of Hamath, heard that David had
defeated the entire army of Hadadezer, king of Zobah, 
10
he sent his son Hadoram to wish King David well
and to congratulate him on having waged a victorious war against Hadadezer; for
Hadadezer had been at war with Tou. He also sent David gold, silver and bronze
utensils of every sort. 
11
These also King David consecrated to the LORD
along with all the silver and gold that he had taken from the nations: from
Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek. 
12
Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, also slew eighteen
thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 
13
He set up garrisons in Edom, and all the
Edomites became David's subjects. Thus the LORD made David victorious in all
his campaigns. 
14
David reigned over all Israel and dispensed
justice and right to all his people. 
15
Joab, son of Zeruiah, was in command of the
army; Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, was herald; 
16
[1]
 Zadok, son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech, son of
Abiathar, were priests; Shavsha was scribe; 
17
[2]
 Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was in command of
the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were the chief assistants
to the king. 
1
 [16] Zadok . . . and Ahimelech, son
of Abiathar, were priests: as in the Chronicler's source, 
⇒
 2
Sam 8:17. But according to 
⇒
 2 Sam
15:24, 
⇒
 29,
⇒
 35; 
⇒
 17:15;
⇒
 19:11; 
⇒
 20:25, and
even 
⇒
 1 Chron 15:11 it was Abiathar who shared
the priestly office with Zadok, and he remained in this office even during the
early years of Solomon's reign (
⇒
 1 Kings 2:26;
⇒
 4:4). Moreover, according to 
⇒
 1
Sam 22:20; 
⇒
 23:6;
⇒
 30:7 Ahimelech was the father, not the son, of
Abiathar. If the text Ahimelech, son of Abiathar, is not due to a scribal
change, one must assume that Abiathar had a son who was named after his
grandfather and who shared the priestly office with his father during the last
years of David's reign. 
2
 [17] David's sons were the chief
assistants to the king: in the parallel passage, 
⇒
 2 Sam 8:18
which was the Chronicler's source, David's sons were priests. The change is
characteristic of the Chronicler, for whom only Aaron's descendants could be
priests.
