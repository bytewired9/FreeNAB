Josiah's successor; cf

 Jeremiah 22:11.
6
 [17-24] The descendants of King
Jechoniah up to the time of the Chronicler. If twenty-five years are allowed to
each generation, the ten generations between Jechoniah and Anani (the last name
on the list) would bring the birth of the latter to about 405 B.C. - an
important item in establishing the approximate date of the Chronicler.

 [18] Shenazzar: presumably the same
as Sheshbazzar of

 Ezra 1:8,

 5:14-16 the
prince of Judah who was the first Jewish governor of Judah after the exile.
Both forms of the name probably go back to the Babylonian name Sin-ab-ussar
signifying, "O [god] Sin, protect [our] father!"
