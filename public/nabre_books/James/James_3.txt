 Not many of you should become teachers, my
brothers, for you realize that we will be judged more strictly, 
2
for we all fall short in many respects. If
anyone does not fall short in speech, he is a perfect man, able to bridle his
whole body also. 
3
If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make
them obey us, we also guide their whole bodies. 
4
It is the same with ships: even though they are
so large and driven by fierce winds, they are steered by a very small rudder
wherever the pilot's inclination wishes. 
5
In the same way the tongue is a small member
and yet has great pretensions. Consider how small a fire can set a huge forest
ablaze. 
6
The tongue is also a fire. It exists among our
members as a world of malice, defiling the whole body and setting the entire
course of our lives on fire, itself set on fire by Gehenna. 
7
For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile
and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species, 
8
but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a
restless evil, full of deadly poison. 
9
With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with
it we curse human beings who are made in the likeness of God. 
10
From the same mouth come blessing and cursing.
This need not be so, my brothers. 
11
Does a spring gush forth from the same opening
both pure and brackish water? 
12
Can a fig tree, my brothers, produce olives, or
a grapevine figs? Neither can salt water yield fresh. 
13
[2]
 Who among you is wise and understanding? Let
him show his works by a good life in the humility that comes from wisdom. 
14
But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish
ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth. 
15
Wisdom of this kind does not come down from
above but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. 
16
For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist,
there is disorder and every foul practice. 
17
But the wisdom from above is first of all pure,
then peaceable, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, without
inconstancy or insincerity. 
18
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace
for those who cultivate peace.

 [1-12] The use and abuse of the
important role of teaching in the church (
⇒
3:1) are here related to the good and bad use of the tongue
(
⇒
 James 3:9-12), the instrument through which
teaching was chiefly conveyed (see 
⇒
 Sirach
5:11-
⇒
 6:1;
⇒
 28:12-26).

 [13-18] This discussion of true
wisdom is related to the previous reflection on the role of the teacher as one
who is in control of his speech. The qualities of the wise man endowed from
above are detailed (
⇒
 James 3:17-18; cf
⇒
 Gal 5:22-23), in contrast to the qualities of
earthbound wisdom (
⇒
 James 3:14-16; cf
⇒
 2 Cor 12:20).
