[1]
 My brothers, show no partiality as you adhere
to the faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ. 
2
For if a man with gold rings on his fingers and
in fine clothes comes into your assembly, and a poor person in shabby clothes
also comes in, 
3
and you pay attention to the one wearing the
fine clothes and say, "Sit here, please," while you say to the poor
one, "Stand there," or "Sit at my feet," 
4
have you not made distinctions among yourselves
and become judges with evil designs? 
[2]
5
Listen, my beloved brothers. Did not God choose
those who are poor 
[3]
 in the world to be rich in faith and
heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those who love him? 
6
But you dishonored the poor person. Are not the
rich oppressing you? And do they themselves not haul you off to court? 
7
Is it not they who blaspheme the noble name
that was invoked over you? 
8
However, if you fulfill the royal 
[4]
law according to the scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as
yourself," you are doing well. 
9
But if you show partiality, you commit sin, and
are convicted by the law as transgressors. 
10
For whoever keeps the whole law, but falls
short in one particular, has become guilty in respect to all of it. 
11
For he who said, "You shall not commit
adultery," also said, "You shall not kill." Even if you do not
commit adultery but kill, you have become a transgressor of the law. 
12
So speak and so act as people who will be
judged by the law of freedom. 
[5]
13
For the judgment is merciless to one who has
not shown mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment. 
14
[6]
 What good is it, my brothers, if someone says
he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? 
15
If a brother or sister has nothing to wear and
has no food for the day, 
16
and one of you says to them, "Go in peace,
keep warm, and eat well," but you do not give them the necessities of the
body, what good is it? 
17
So also faith of itself, if it does not have
works, is dead. 
18
Indeed someone might say, "You have faith
and I have works." Demonstrate your faith to me without works, and I will
demonstrate my faith to you from my works. 
19
You believe that God is one. You do well. Even
the demons believe that and tremble. 
20
Do you want proof, you ignoramus, that faith
without works is useless? 
21
Was not Abraham our father justified by works
when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar? 
22
You see that faith was active along with his
works, and faith was completed by the works. 
23
Thus the scripture was fulfilled that says,
"Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,"
and he was called "the friend of God." 
24
See how a person is justified by works and not
by faith alone. 
25
And in the same way, was not Rahab the harlot
also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by a
different route? 
26
For just as a body without a spirit is dead, so
also faith without works is dead.

 [1-13] In the Christian community
there must be no discrimination or favoritism based on status or wealth
(
⇒
 James 2:2-4; cf 
⇒
 Matthew
5:3; 
⇒
 11:5; 
⇒
 23:6;
⇒
 1 Cor 1:27-29). Divine favor rather consists in
God's election and promises (
⇒
 James 2:5). The rich
who oppress the poor blaspheme the name of Christ (
⇒
2:6-7). By violating one law of love of neighbor, they offend against
the whole law (
⇒
 James 2:8-11). On the other hand,
conscious awareness of the final judgment helps the faithful to fulfill the
whole law (
⇒
 James 2:12). 
2
 [4] When Christians show favoritism
to the rich they are guilty of the worst kind of prejudice and discrimination.
The author says that such Christians set themselves up as judges who judge not
by divine law but by the basest, self-serving motives.
3
 [5] The poor, "God's
poor" of the Old Testament, were seen by Jesus as particularly open to God
for belief in and reliance on him alone (
⇒
 Luke
6:20). God's law cannot tolerate their oppression in any way
(
⇒
 James 2:9).
4
 [8] Royal: literally,
"kingly"; because the Mosaic law came from God, the universal king.
There may be an allusion to Jesus' uses of this commandment in his preaching of
the kingdom of God (
⇒
 Matthew 22:39;
⇒
 Mark 12:31; 
⇒
 Luke
10:27).
5
 [12-13] The law upon which the last
judgment will be based is the law of freedom. As Jesus taught, mercy (which
participates in God's own loving mercy) includes forgiveness of those who wrong
us (see 
⇒
 Matthew 6:12,
⇒
 14-15).
6
 [14-26] The theme of these verses is
the relationship of faith and works (deeds). It has been argued that the
teaching here contradicts that of Paul (see especially 
⇒
 Romans
4:5-6). The problem can only be understood if the different
viewpoints of the two authors are seen. Paul argues against those who claim to
participate in God's salvation because of their good deeds as well as because
they have committed themselves to trust in God through Jesus Christ (Paul's
concept of faith). Paul certainly understands, however, the implications of
true faith for a life of love and generosity (see 
⇒
 Gal
5:6, 
⇒
 13-15). The author of James is well
aware that proper conduct can only come about with an authentic commitmentto God
in faith (
⇒
 James 2:18,
⇒
 26). Many think he was seeking to correct a
misunderstanding of Paul's view.
