As for you, son of man, take a clay tablet; lay
it in front of you, and draw on it a city (Jerusalem). 
2
Raise a siege against it: build a tower, lay
out a ramp, pitch camps, and set up batteringrams all around. 
3
Then take an iron griddle and set it up as an
iron wall between you and the city. Fix your gaze on it: it shall be in the
state of siege, and you shall besiege it. This shall be a sign for the house of
Israel. 
4
Then you shall lie on your left side, while I
place the sins of the house of Israel upon you. As many days as you lie thus,
you shall bear their sins. 
5
[1]
 For the years of their sins I allot you the
same number of days, three hundred and ninety, during which you will bear the
sins of the house of Israel. 
6
When you finish this, you are to lie down
again, but on your right side, and bear the sins of the house of Judah forty
days; one day for each year I have allotted you. 
7
[2]
 Fixing your gaze on the siege of Jerusalem,
with bared arm you shall prophesy against it. 
8
See, I will bind you with cords so that you
cannot turn from one side to the other until you have completed the days of
your siege. 
9
[3]
 Again, take wheat and barley, and beans and
lentils, and millet and spelt; put them in a single vessel and make bread out
of them. Eat it for as many days as you lie upon your side, three hundred and
ninety. 
10
The food you eat shall be twenty shekels a day
by weight; each day the same. 
11
And the water you drink shall be the sixth of a
hin by measure; each day the same. 
16
[4]
 Then he said to me: Son of man, I am breaking
the staff of bread in Jerusalem. They shall eat bread which they have weighed
out anxiously, and they shall drink water which they have measured out
fearfully, 
17
so that, owing to the scarcity of bread and
water, everyone shall be filled with terror and waste away because of his sins.
12
For your food you must bake barley loaves over
human excrement in their sight, said the LORD. 
13
Thus the Israelites shall eat their food
unclean among the nations where I scatter them. 
14
"Oh no, Lord GOD!" I protested.
"Never have I been made unclean, and from my youth till now, never have I
eaten carrion flesh or that torn by wild beasts; never has any unclean meat
entered my mouth." 
15
Very well, he replied, I allow you cow's dung
in place of human excrement; bake your bread on that. 
1
 [5-6] Three hundred and ninety days
. . . forty days: symbolically representing the respective lengths of the
periods of exile of northern Israelites and Judahites. Northern Israel had
already fallen to Assyria in 722 B.C. The letters in the Hebrew phrase for the
days of your siege (
⇒
 Ezekiel 4:8), each of which has
its own numerical value, add up to three hundred and ninety. Forty years
represent one generation. 
2
 [7] Bared arm: a symbol of
unrestrained power.
3
 [9-13] This action represents the
scarcity of food during the siege of Jerusalem, and the consequent need to eat
whatever is at hand. Twenty shekels: about nine ounces. The sixth of a hin:
about one quart.
4
 [16] (16) Breaking the staff of
bread: reducing the supply of bread which sustains the life of man as the
walking staff sustains the traveler on his journey; cf
