[1]
 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ
is begotten by God, and everyone who loves the father loves (also) the one
begotten by him. 
2
In this way we know that we love the children
of God when we love God and obey his commandments. 
3
For the love of God is this, that we keep his
commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome, 
4
for whoever is begotten by God conquers the
world. And the victory that conquers the world is our faith. 
5
Who (indeed) is the victor over the world but
the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 
6
This is the one who came through water and
blood, 
[2]
 Jesus Christ, not by water alone, but by water and
blood. The Spirit is the one that testifies, and the Spirit is truth. 
7
So there are three that testify, 
8
the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and the
three are of one accord. 
9
If we accept human testimony, the testimony of
God is surely greater. Now the testimony of God is this, that he has testified
on behalf of his Son. 
10
Whoever believes in the Son of God has this
testimony within himself. Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar by
not believing the testimony God has given about his Son. 
11
And this is the testimony: God gave us eternal
life, and this life is in his Son. 
12
Whoever possesses the Son has life; whoever
does not possess the Son of God does not have life. 
13
[3]
 I write these things to you so that you may
know that you have eternal life, you who believe in the name of the Son of God.
14
And we have this confidence in him, that if we
ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 
15
And if we know that he hears us in regard to
whatever we ask, we know that what we have asked him for is ours. 
16
If anyone sees his brother sinning, if the sin
is not deadly, he should pray to God and he will give him life. This is only
for those whose sin is not deadly. There is such a thing as deadly sin, about
which I do not say that you should pray. 
17
All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is
not deadly. 
18
We know that no one begotten by God sins; but
the one begotten by God he protects, and the evil one cannot touch him. 
19
We know that we belong to God, and the whole
world is under the power of the evil one. 
20
We also know that the Son of God has come and
has given us discernment to know the one who is true. And we are in the one who
is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. 
21
Children, be on your guard against idols. 
1
 [1-5] Children of God are
identified not only by their love for others (
⇒
4:7-9) and for God (
⇒
 1 John 5:1-2) but by
their belief in the divine sonship of Jesus Christ. Faith, the acceptance of
Jesus in his true character and the obedience in love to God's commands
(
⇒
 1 John 5:3), is the source of the Christian's
power in the world and conquers the world of evil (
⇒
5:4-5), even as Christ overcame the world (
⇒
 John
16:33). 
2
 [6-12] Water and blood
(
⇒
 1 John 5:6) refers to Christ's baptism
(
⇒
 Matthew 3:16-17) and to the shedding of his blood
on the cross (
⇒
 John 19:34). The Spirit was present
at the baptism (
⇒
 Matthew 3:16; 
⇒
 Mark
1:10; 
⇒
 Luke 3:22; 
⇒
 John
1:32, 
⇒
 34). The testimony to Christ as
the Son of God is confirmed by divine witness (
⇒
 1 John 5:7-9),
greater by far than the two legally required human witnesses
(
⇒
 Deut 17:6). To deny this is to deny God's truth;
cf 
⇒
 John 8:17-18. The gist of the divine witness or
testimony is that eternal life (
⇒
 1 John 5:11-12)
is given in Christ and nowhere else. To possess the Son is not acceptance of a
doctrine but of a person who lives now and provides life.
3
 [13-21] As children of God we have
confidence in prayer because of our intimate relationship with him
(
⇒
 1 John 5:14-15). In love, we pray
(
⇒
 1 John 5:16-17) for those who are in sin, but
not in deadly sin (literally, "sin unto death"), probably referring
to apostasy or activities brought on under the antichrist; cf
⇒
 Mark 3:29; 
⇒
 Hebrews
6:4-6; 
⇒
 10:26-31. Even in the latter
case, however, prayer, while not enjoined, is not forbidden. The letter
concludes with a summary of the themes of the letter (
⇒
 1
John 5:18-20). There is a sharp antithesis between the children of
God and those belonging to the world and to the evil one. The Son reveals the God
of truth; Christians dwell in the true God, in his Son, and have eternal life.
The final verse (
⇒
 1 John 5:21) voices a perennial
warning about idols, any type of rival to God.
