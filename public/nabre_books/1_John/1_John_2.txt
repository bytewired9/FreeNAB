My children, 
[1]
 I am writing this
to you so that you may not commit sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an
Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous one. 
2
He is expiation for our sins, and not for our
sins only but for those of the whole world. 
3
The way we may be sure 
[2]
that we know him is to keep his command ments. 
4
Whoever says, "I know him," but does
not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 
5
But whoever keeps his word, the love of God is
truly perfected in him. This is the way we may know that we are in union with
him: 
6
whoever claims to abide in him ought to live
(just) as he lived. 
7
[3]
 Beloved, I am writing no new commandment to
you but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. The old commandment
is the word that you have heard. 
8
And yet I do write a new commandment to you,
which holds true in him and among you, 
[4]
 for the darkness is
passing away, and the true light is already shining. 
9
Whoever says he is in the light, yet hates his
brother, is still in the darkness. 
10
Whoever loves his brother remains in the light,
and there is nothing in him to cause a fall. 
11
Whoever hates his brother is in darkness; he
walks in darkness and does not know where he is going because the darkness has
blinded his eyes. 
12
[5]
 I am writing to you, children, because your sins
have been forgiven for his name's sake. 
[6]
13
I am writing to you, fathers, because you know
him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have
conquered the evil one. 
14
I write to you, children, because you know the
Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the
beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong and the word of
God remains in you, and you have conquered the evil one. 
15
Do not love the world or the things of the
world. 
[7]
 If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father
is not in him. 
16
For all that is in the world, sensual lust, 
[8]
enticement for the eyes, and a pretentious life, is not from the Father but is
from the world. 
17
Yet the world and its enticement are passing
away. But whoever does the will of God remains forever. 
18
Children, it is the last hour; 
[9]
and just as you heard that the antichrist was coming, so now many antichrists
have appeared. Thus we know this is the last hour. 
19
They went out from us, but they were not really
of our number; 
[10]
 if they had been, they would have remained
with us. Their desertion shows that none of them was of our number. 
20
But you have the anointing that comes from the
holy one, 
[11]
 and you all have knowledge. 
21
I write to you not because you do not know the
truth but because you do, and because every lie is alien to the truth. 
22
[12]
 Who is the liar? Whoever denies that Jesus is
the Christ. Whoever denies the Father and the Son, this is the antichrist. 
23
No one who denies the Son has the Father, but
whoever confesses the Son has the Father as well. 
24
Let what you heard from the beginning remain in
you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, then you will remain
in the Son and in the Father. 
[13]
25
And this is the promise that he made us:
eternal life. 
26
I write you these things about those who would
deceive you. 
27
As for you, the anointing that you received from
him remains in you, so that you do not need anyone to teach you. But his
anointing teaches you about everything and is true and not false; just as it
taught you, remain in him. 
28
[14]
 And now, children, remain in him, so that when
he appears we may have confidence and not be put to shame by him at his coming.
29
If you consider that he is righteous, you also
know that everyone who acts in righteousness is begotten by him. 
1
 [1] Children: like the term
"beloved," this is an expression of pastoral love (cf
⇒
 John 13:33; 
⇒
 21:5;
⇒
 1 Cor 4:14). Advocate: for the use of the term,
see 
⇒
 John 14:16. Forgiveness of sin is assured
through Christ's intercession and expiation or "offering"; the death
of Christ effected the removal of sin. 
2
 [3-6] The way we may be sure: to
those who claim, "I have known Christ and therefore I know him," our
author insists on not mere intellectual knowledge but obedience to God's
commandments in a life conformed to the example of Christ; this confirms our
knowledge of him and is the love of God . . . perfected. Disparity between
moral life and the commandments proves improper belief.
3
 [7-11] The author expresses the
continuity and freshness of mutual charity in Christian experience. Through
Christ the commandment of love has become the light defeating the darkness of
evil in a new age. All hatred as darkness is incompatible with the light and
Christian life. Note also the characteristic Johannine polemic in which a
positive assertion is emphasized by the negative statement of its opposite.
4
 [8] Which holds true in him and
among you: literally, "a thing that holds true in him and in you."
5
 [12-17] The Christian community
that has experienced the grace of God through forgiveness of sin and knowledge
of Christ is armed against the evil one.
6
 [12] For his name's sake: because
of Christ our sins are forgiven.
7
 [15] The world: all that is hostile
toward God and alienated from him. Love of the world and love of God are thus
mutually exclusive; cf 
⇒
 James 4:4.
8
 [16] Sensual lust: literally,
"the lust of the flesh," inordinate desire for physical
gratification. Enticement for the eyes: literally, "the lust of the
eyes," avarice or covetousness; the eyes are regarded as the windows of
the soul. Pretentious life: literally, "pride of life," arrogance or
ostentation in one's earthly style of life that reflects a willful independence
from God and others.
9
 [18] It is the last hour:
literally, "a last hour," the period between the death and
resurrection of Christ and his second coming. The antichrist: opponent or
adversary of Christ; the term appears only in 1 John - 2 John, but
"pseudochrists" (translated "false messiahs") in
⇒
 Matthew 24:24 and 
⇒
 Mark
13:22, and Paul's "lawless one" in 
⇒
 2
Thes 2:3, are similar figures. Many antichrists: Matthew, Mark, and
Rev seem to indicate a collectivity of persons, here related to the false
teachers.
10
 [19] Not really of our number: the
apostate teachers only proved their lack of faith by leaving the community.
11
 [20] The anointing that comes from
the holy one: this anointing is in the Old Testament sense of receiving the
Spirit of God. The Holy One probably refers to Christ. True knowledge is the
gift of the Spirit (cf 
⇒
 Isaiah 11:2), and the
function of the Spirit is to lead Christians to the truth
(
⇒
 John 14:17, 
⇒
 26;
⇒
 16:13).
12
 [22-23] Certain gnostics denied
that the earthly Jesus was the Christ; to deny knowledge of the Son is to deny
the Father, since only through the Son has God been fully revealed
(
⇒
 John 1:18; 
⇒
 14:8-9).
13
 [24] Continuity with the apostolic
witness as proclaimed in the prologue is the safeguard of right belief.
14
 [28-29] Our confidence at his
judgment is based on the daily assurance of salvation. Our actions reflect our
true relation to him.
