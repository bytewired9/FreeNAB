[2]
 When he had said this, Jesus
went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley to where there was a
garden, into which he and his disciples entered. 
2
Judas his betrayer also knew the place, because
Jesus had often met there with his disciples. 
3
So Judas got a band of soldiers 
[3]
and guards from the chief priests and the Pharisees and went there with
lanterns, torches, and weapons. 
4
Jesus, knowing everything that was going to
happen to him, went out and said to them, "Whom are you looking for?"
5
They answered him, "Jesus the
Nazorean." 
[4]
 He said to them, "I AM." Judas
his betrayer was also with them. 
6
When he said to them, "I AM," they
turned away and fell to the ground. 
7
So he again asked them, "Whom are you
looking for?" They said, "Jesus the Nazorean." 
8
Jesus answered, "I told you that I AM. So
if you are looking for me, let these men go." 
9
[5]
 This was to fulfill what he had said, "I
have not lost any of those you gave me." 
10
Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it,
struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave's name was
Malchus. 
[6]
11
Jesus said to Peter, "Put your sword into
its scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup 
[7]
 that the Father
gave me?" 
12
So the band of soldiers, the tribune, and the
Jewish guards seized Jesus, bound him, 
13
and brought him to Annas 
[8]
first. He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. 
14
It was Caiaphas who had counseled the Jews that
it was better that one man should die rather than the people. 
15
Simon Peter and another disciple 
[9]
followed Jesus. Now the other disciple was known to the high priest, and he
entered the courtyard of the high priest with Jesus. 
16
But Peter stood at the gate outside. So the
other disciple, the acquaintance of the high priest, went out and spoke to the
gatekeeper and brought Peter in. 
17
Then the maid who was the gatekeeper said to
Peter, "You are not one of this man's disciples, are you?" He said,
"I am not." 
18
Now the slaves and the guards were standing
around a charcoal fire that they had made, because it was cold, and were
warming themselves. Peter was also standing there keeping warm. 
19
The high priest questioned Jesus about his
disciples and about his doctrine. 
20
Jesus answered him, "I have spoken
publicly to the world. I have always taught in a synagogue or in the temple
area 
[10]
 where all the Jews gather, and in secret I have said
nothing. 
21
Why ask me? Ask those who heard me what I said
to them. They know what I said." 
22
When he had said this, one of the temple guards
standing there struck Jesus and said, "Is this the way you answer the high
priest?" 
23
Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken
wrongly, testify to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike
me?" 
24
Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas 
[11]
the high priest. 
25
Now Simon Peter was standing there keeping
warm. And they said to him, "You are not one of his disciples, are
you?" He denied it and said, "I am not." 
26
One of the slaves of the high priest, a
relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Didn't I see you
in the garden with him?" 
27
Again Peter denied it. And immediately the cock
crowed. 
[12]
28
Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the
praetorium. 
[13]
 It was morning. And they themselves did not
enter the praetorium, in order not to be defiled so that they could eat the
Passover. 
29
So Pilate came out to them and said, "What
charge do you bring (against) this man?" 
30
They answered and said to him, "If he were
not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you." 
31
At this, Pilate said to them, "Take him
yourselves, and judge him according to your law." The Jews answered him,
"We do not have the right to execute anyone," 
[14]
32
[15]
 in order that the word of Jesus might be
fulfilled that he said indicating the kind of death he would die. 
33
So Pilate went back into the praetorium and
summoned Jesus and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" 
34
Jesus answered, "Do you say this on your
own or have others told you about me?" 
35
Pilate answered, "I am not a Jew, am I?
Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me. What have you
done?" 
36
Jesus answered, "My kingdom does not
belong to this world. If my kingdom did belong to this world, my attendants
(would) be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it
is, my kingdom is not here." 
37
So Pilate said to him, "Then you are a
king?" Jesus answered, "You say I am a king. 
[16]
For this I was born and for this I came into the world, to testify to the
truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice." 
38
Pilate said to him, "What is truth?"
When he had said this, he again went out to the Jews and said to them, "I
find no guilt in him. 
39
But you have a custom that I release one
prisoner to you at Passover. 
[17]
 Do you want me to release to
you the King of the Jews?" 
40
They cried out again, "Not this one but
Barabbas!" 
[18]
 Now Barabbas was a revolutionary. 
1
 [1-14] John does not mention the
agony in the garden and the kiss of Judas, nor does he identify the place as
Gethsemane or the Mount of Olives.
2
 [1] Jesus went out: see
⇒
 John 14:31 where it seems he is leaving the
supper room. Kidron valley: literally, "the winter-flowing Kidron";
this wadi has water only during the winter rains. 
3
 [3] Band of soldiers: seems to
refer to Roman troops, either the full cohort of 600 men (1/10 of a legion), or
more likely the maniple of 200 under their tribune (
⇒
18:12). In this case, John is hinting at Roman collusion in the
action against Jesus before he was brought to Pilate. The lanterns and torches
may be symbolic of the hour of darkness.
4
 [5] Nazorean: the form found in
⇒
 Matthew 26:71 (see the note on
⇒
 Matthew 2:23) is here used, not Nazarene of Mark.
I AM: or "I am he," but probably intended by the evangelist as an
expression of divinity (cf their appropriate response in
⇒
 John 18:6); see the note on
⇒
 John 8:24. John sets the confusion of the
arresting party against the background of Jesus' divine majesty.
5
 [9] The citation may refer to
⇒
 John 6:39; 
⇒
 10:28; or
⇒
 John 17:12.
6
 [10] Only John gives the names of
the two antagonists; both John and Luke mention the right ear.
7
 [11] The theme of the cup is found
in the synoptic account of the agony (
⇒
 Mark 14:36
and parallels).
8
 [13] Annas: only John mentions an
inquiry before Annas; cf 
⇒
 John 18:16, 
⇒
 19-24;
see the note on 
⇒
 Luke 3:2. It is unlikely that this
nighttime interrogation before Annas is the same as the trial before Caiaphas
placed by Matthew and Mark at night and by Luke in the morning.
9
 [15-16] Another disciple . . . the
other disciple: see the note on 
⇒
 John 13:23.
10
 [20] I have always taught . . . in
the temple area: cf 
⇒
 Mark 14:49 for a similar
statement.
11
 [24] Caiaphas: see
⇒
 Matthew 26:3, 
⇒
 57;
⇒
 Luke 3:2; and the notes there. John may leave room
here for the trial before Caiaphas described in the synoptic gospels.
12
 [27] Cockcrow was the third Roman
division of the night, lasting from midnight to 3 A.M.
13
 [28] Praetorium: see the note on
⇒
 Matthew 27:27. Morning: literally, "the
early hour," or fourth Roman division of the night, 3 to 6 A.M. The
Passover: the synoptic gospels give the impression that the Thursday night
supper was the Passover meal (
⇒
 Mark 14:12); for
John that meal is still to be eaten Friday night.
14
 [31] We do not have the right to
execute anyone: only John gives this reason for their bringing Jesus to Pilate.
Jewish sources are not clear on the competence of the Sanhedrin at this period
to sentence and to execute for political crimes.
15
 [32] The Jewish punishment for
blasphemy was stoning (
⇒
 Lev 24:16). In coming to
the Romans to ensure that Jesus would be crucified, the Jewish authorities
fulfilled his prophecy that he would be exalted (
⇒
3:14; 
⇒
 12:32-33). There is some
historical evidence, however, for Jews crucifying Jews.
16
 [37] You say I am a king: see
⇒
 Matthew 26:64 for a similar response to the high
priest. It is at best a reluctant affirmative.
17
 [39] See the note on
⇒
 Matthew 27:15.
18
 [40] Barabbas: see the note on
⇒
 Matthew 27:16-17. Revolutionary: a guerrilla
warrior fighting for nationalistic aims, though the term can also denote a
robber. See the note on 
⇒
 Matthew 27:38.
