"I have told you this so that you may not
fall away. 
2
They will expel you from the synagogues; in
fact, the hour 
[1]
 is coming when everyone who kills you will
think he is offering worship to God. 
3
They will do this because they have not known
either the Father or me. 
4
I have told you this so that when their hour
comes you may remember that I told you. 
[2]
 "I did not
tell you this from the beginning, because I was with you. 
5
But now I am going to the one who sent me, and
not one of you asks me, 
[3]
 'Where are you going?' 
6
But because I told you this, grief has filled
your hearts. 
7
But I tell you the truth, it is better for you
that I go. For if I do not go, the Advocate will not come to you. But if I go,
I will send him to you. 
8
[4]
 And when he comes he will convict the world in
regard to sin and righteousness and condemnation: 
9
sin, because they do not believe in me; 
10
righteousness, because I am going to the Father
and you will no longer see me; 
11
condemnation, because the ruler of this world
has been condemned. Coming of the Advocate 
12
"I have much more to tell you, but you
cannot bear it now. 
13
[5]
 But when he comes, the Spirit of truth, he
will guide you to all truth. He will not speak on his own, but he will speak
what he hears, and will declare to you the things that are coming. 
14
He will glorify me, because he will take from
what is mine and declare it to you. 
15
Everything that the Father has is mine; for
this reason I told you that he will take from what is mine and declare it to
you. 
16
"A little while and you will no longer see
me, and again a little while later and you will see me." 
17
So some of his disciples said to one another,
"What does this mean that he is saying to us, 'A little while and you will
not see me, and again a little while and you will see me,' and 'Because I am
going to the Father'?" 
18
So they said, "What is this 'little while'
(of which he speaks)? We do not know what he means." 
19
Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, so he
said to them, "Are you discussing with one another what I said, 'A little
while and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me'? 
20
Amen, amen, I say to you, you will weep and
mourn, while the world rejoices; you will grieve, but your grief will become
joy. 
21
When a woman is in labor, she is in anguish
because her hour has arrived; but when she has given birth to a child, she no
longer remembers the pain because of her joy that a child has been born into
the world. 
22
So you also are now in anguish. But I will see
you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away
from you. 
23
On that day you will not question me about anything.
Amen, amen, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give
you. 
24
Until now you have not asked anything in my
name; ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete. 
25
[6]
 "I have told you this in figures of
speech. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures but I
will tell you clearly about the Father. 
26
On that day you will ask in my name, and I do
not tell you that I will ask the Father for you. 
27
For the Father himself loves you, because you
have loved me and have come to believe that I came from God. 
28
I came from the Father and have come into the
world. Now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father." 
29
His disciples said, "Now you are talking
plainly, and not in any figure of speech. 
30
Now we realize that you know everything and that
you do not need to have anyone question you. Because of this we believe that
you came from God." 
[7]
31
Jesus answered them, "Do you believe now? 
32
Behold, the hour is coming and has arrived when
each of you will be scattered 
[8]
 to his own home and you will
leave me alone. But I am not alone, because the Father is with me. 
33
I have told you this so that you might have
peace in me. In the world you will have trouble, but take courage, I have
conquered the world." 
1
 [2] Hour: of persecution, not
Jesus' "hour" (see the note on 
⇒
 John 2:4).
2
 [4b-33] A duplicate of
⇒
 John 14:1-31 on departure and return.
3
 [5] Not one of you asks me: the
difficulty of reconciling this with Simon Peter's question in
⇒
 John 13:36 and Thomas' words in
⇒
 John 14:5 strengthens the supposition that the
last discourse has been made up of several collections of Johannine material.
4
 [8-11] These verses illustrate the
forensic character of the Paraclete's role: in the forum of the disciples'
conscience he prosecutes the world. He leads believers to see (a) that the
basic sin was and is refusal to believe in Jesus; (b) that, although Jesus was
found guilty and apparently died in disgrace, in reality righteousness has
triumphed, for Jesus has returned to his Father; (c) finally, that it is the
ruler of this world, Satan, who has been condemned through Jesus' death
(
⇒
 John 12:32).
5
 [13] Declare to you the things that
are coming: not a reference to new predictions about the future, but
interpretation of what has already occurred or been said.
6
 [25] See the note on
⇒
 John 10:6. Here, possibly a reference to
⇒
 John 15:1-16 or 
⇒
16:21.
7
 [30] The reference is seemingly to
the fact that Jesus could anticipate their question in 
⇒
16:19. The disciples naively think they have the full understanding
that is the climax of "the hour" of Jesus' death, resurrection, and
ascension (
⇒
 John 16:25), but the only part of the
hour that is at hand for them is their share in the passion (
⇒
16:32).

 Matthew
26:31, where both cite

about the sheep being dispersed.
