[1]
 Six days before Passover Jesus came to
Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. 
2
They gave a dinner for him there, and Martha served,
while Lazarus was one of those reclining at table with him. 
3
Mary took a liter of costly perfumed oil made
from genuine aromatic nard and anointed the feet of Jesus 
[2]
and dried them with her hair; the house was filled with the fragrance of the
oil. 
4
Then Judas the Iscariot, one (of) his
disciples, and the one who would betray him, said, 
5
"Why was this oil not sold for three
hundred days' wages 
[3]
 and given to the poor?" 
6
He said this not because he cared about the
poor but because he was a thief and held the money bag and used to steal the
contributions. 
7
So Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Let her
keep this for the day of my burial. 
[4]
8
You always have the poor with you, but you do
not always have me." 
9
(The) large crowd of the Jews found out that he
was there and came, not only because of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom he
had raised from the dead. 
10
And the chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus
too, 
11
because many of the Jews were turning away and
believing in Jesus because of him. 
12
[5]
 On the next day, when the great crowd that had
come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
13
they took palm branches 
[6]
and went out to meet him, and cried out: "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes
in the name of the Lord, (even) the king of Israel." 
14
Jesus found an ass and sat upon it, as is
written: 
15
"Fear no more, O daughter Zion; 
[7]
see, your king comes, seated upon an ass's colt." 
16
His disciples did not understand this at first,
but when Jesus had been glorified they remembered that these things were
written about him and that they had done this 
[8]
 for him. 
17
[9]
 So the crowd that was with him when he called
Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from death continued to testify. 
18
This was (also) why the crowd went to meet him,
because they heard that he had done this sign. 
19
So the Pharisees said to one another, "You
see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the whole world 
[10]
has gone after him." 
20
[11]
 Now there were some Greeks 
[12]
among those who had come up to worship at the feast. 
21
[13]
 They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in
Galilee, and asked him, "Sir, we would like to see Jesus." 
22
Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and
Philip went and told Jesus. 
23
[14]
 Jesus answered them, "The hour has come
for the Son of Man to be glorified. 
24
[15]
 Amen, amen, I say to you, unless a grain of
wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains just a grain of wheat; but if it
dies, it produces much fruit. 
25
Whoever loves his life 
[16]
loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will preserve it for eternal
life. 
26
Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I
am, there also will my servant be. The Father will honor whoever serves me. 
27
"I am troubled 
[17]
 now.
Yet what should I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? But it was for this
purpose that I came to this hour. 
28
Father, glorify your name." Then a voice
came from heaven, "I have glorified it and will glorify it again." 
29
The crowd there heard it and said it was
thunder; but others said, "An angel has spoken to him." 
30
Jesus answered and said, "This voice did
not come for my sake but for yours. 
31
Now is the time of judgment on this world; now
the ruler of this world 
[18]
 will be driven out. 
32
And when I am lifted up from the earth, I will
draw everyone to myself." 
33
He said this indicating the kind of death he
would die. 
34
So the crowd answered him, "We have heard
from the law that the Messiah remains forever. 
[19]
 Then how
can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of
Man?" 
35
Jesus said to them, "The light will be
among you only a little while. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness
may not overcome you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where he is
going. 
36
While you have the light, believe in the light,
so that you may become children of the light." 
After he had said this, Jesus left and hid from them.
37
[20]
 Although he had performed so many signs in
their presence they did not believe in him, 
38
[21]
 in order that the word which Isaiah the
prophet spoke might be fulfilled: "Lord, who has believed our preaching,
to whom has the might of the Lord been revealed?" 
39
For this reason they could not believe, because
again Isaiah said: 
40
"He blinded their eyes and hardened their
heart, so that they might not see with their eyes and understand with their
heart and be converted, and I would heal them." 
41
Isaiah said this because he saw his glory 
[22]
and spoke about him. 
42
Nevertheless, many, even among the authorities,
believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not acknowledge it
openly in order not to be expelled from the synagogue. 
43
For they preferred human praise to the glory of
God. 
44
Jesus cried out and said, "Whoever
believes in me believes not only in me but also in the one who sent me, 
45
and whoever sees me sees the one who sent me. 
46
I came into the world as light, so that
everyone who believes in me might not remain in darkness. 
47
And if anyone hears my words and does not
observe them, I do not condemn him, for I did not come to condemn the world but
to save the world. 
48
Whoever rejects me and does not accept my words
has something to judge him: the word that I spoke, it will condemn him on the
last day, 
49
because I did not speak on my own, but the
Father who sent me commanded me what to say and speak. 
50
And I know that his commandment is eternal
life. So what I say, I say as the Father told me." 
1
 [1-8] This is probably the same
scene of anointing found in 
⇒
 Mark 14:3-9 (see the
note there) and 
⇒
 Matthew 26:6-13. The anointing by
a penitent woman in 
⇒
 Luke 7:36-38 is different.
Details from these various episodes have become interchanged. 
2
 [3] The feet of Jesus: so
⇒
 Mark 14:3; but in 
⇒
 Matthew
26:6, Mary anoints Jesus' head as a sign of regal, messianic
anointing.
3
 [5] Days' wages: literally,
"denarii." A denarius is a day's wage in 
⇒
 Matthew
20:2; see the note on 
⇒
 John 6:7.
4
 [7] Jesus' response reflects the
rabbinical discussion of what was the greatest act of mercy, almsgiving or
burying the dead. Those who favored proper burial of the dead thought it an
essential condition for sharing in the resurrection.
5
 [12-19] In John, the entry into
Jerusalem follows the anointing whereas in the synoptics it precedes. In John,
the crowd, not the disciples, are responsible for the triumphal procession.
6
 [13] Palm branches: used to welcome
great conquerors; cf 
⇒
 1 Macc 13:51;
⇒
 2 Macc 10:7. They may be related to the lulab,
the twig bundles used at the feast of Tabernacles. Hosanna: see
⇒
 Psalm 118:25-26. The Hebrew word means: "(O
Lord), grant salvation." He who comes in the name of the Lord: referred in
⇒
 Psalm 118:26 to a pilgrim entering the temple
gates, but here a title for Jesus (see the notes on 
⇒
 Matthew
11:3 and 
⇒
 John 6:14;
⇒
 11:27). The king of Israel: perhaps from
⇒
 Zephaniah 3:14-15 in connection with the next
quotation from 
⇒
 Zechariah 9:9.
7
 [15] Daughter Zion: Jerusalem.
Ass's colt: symbol of peace, as opposed to the war horse.
8
 [16] They had done this: the
antecedent of they is ambiguous.
9
 [17-18] There seem to be two
different crowds in these verses. There are some good witnesses to the text
that have another reading for 
⇒
 John 12:17:
"Then the crowd that was with him began to testify that he had called
Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead."
10
 [19] The whole world: the sense is
that everyone is following Jesus, but John has an ironic play on world; he
alludes to the universality of salvation (
⇒
3:17; 
⇒
 4:42).
11
 [20-36[ This announcement of
glorification by death is an illustration of "the whole world" (19)
going after him.
12
 [20] Greeks: not used here in a
nationalistic sense. These are probably Gentile proselytes to Judaism; cf
⇒
 John 7:35.
13
 [21-22] Philip . . . Andrew: the approach is made through
disciples who have distinctly Greek names, suggesting that access to Jesus was
mediated to the Greek world through his disciples. Philip and Andrew were from
Bethsaida (
⇒
 John 1:44); Galileans were mostly
bilingual. See: here seems to mean "have an interview with."
14
 [23] Jesus' response suggests that
only after the crucifixion could the gospel encompass both Jew and Gentile.
15
 [24] This verse implies that
through his death Jesus will be accessible to all. It remains just a grain of
wheat: this saying is found in the synoptic triple and double traditions
(
⇒
 Mark 8:35; 
⇒
 Matthew
16:25; 
⇒
 Luke 9:24;
⇒
 Matthew 10:39; 
⇒
 Luke 17:33).
John adds the phrases (
⇒
 John 12:25) in this world
and for eternal life.
16
 [25] His life: the Greek word
psyche refers to a person's natural life. It does not mean "soul,"
for Hebrew anthropology did not postulate body/soul dualism in the way that is
familiar to us.
17
 [27] I am troubled: perhaps an
allusion to the Gethsemane agony scene of the synoptics.
18
 [31] Ruler of this world: Satan.
19
 [34] There is no passage in the Old
Testament that states precisely that the Messiah remains forever. Perhaps the
closest is 
⇒
 Psalm 89:37.
20
 [37-50] These verses, on unbelief
of the Jews, provide an epilogue to the Book of Signs.
21
 [38-41] John gives a historical
explanation of the disbelief of the Jewish people, not a psychological one. The
Old Testament had to be fulfilled; the disbelief that met Isaiah's message was
a foreshadowing of the disbelief that Jesus encountered. In 
⇒
12:42 and also in 
⇒
 John 3:20 we see that
there is no negation of freedom.
22
 [41] His glory: Isaiah saw the
glory of Yahweh enthroned in the heavenly temple, but in John the antecedent of
his is Jesus.
