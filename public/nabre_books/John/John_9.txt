[1]
 As he passed by he saw a man blind from birth.
2
[2]
 His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who
sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?" 
3
Jesus answered, "Neither he nor his
parents sinned; it is so that the works of God might be made visible through
him. 
4
We have to do the works of the one who sent me
while it is day. Night is coming when no one can work. 
5
While I am in the world, I am the light of the
world." 
6
When he had said this, he spat on the ground
and made clay with the saliva, and smeared the clay on his eyes, 
7
and said to him, "Go wash 
[3]
in the Pool of Siloam" (which means Sent). So he went and washed, and came
back able to see. 
8
His neighbors and those who had seen him
earlier as a beggar said, "Isn't this the one who used to sit and
beg?" 
9
Some said, "It is," but others said,
"No, he just looks like him." He said, "I am." 
10
So they said to him, "(So) how were your
eyes opened?" 
11
He replied, "The man called Jesus made
clay and anointed my eyes and told me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' So I went there
and washed and was able to see." 
12
And they said to him, "Where is he?"
He said, "I don't know." 
13
They brought the one who was once blind to the
Pharisees. 
14
Now Jesus had made clay 
[4]
and opened his eyes on a sabbath. 
15
So then the Pharisees also asked him how he was
able to see. He said to them, "He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and
now I can see." 
16
So some of the Pharisees said, "This man
is not from God, because he does not keep the sabbath." (But) others said,
"How can a sinful man do such signs?" And there was a division among
them. 
17
So they said to the blind man again, "What
do you have to say about him, since he opened your eyes?" He said,
"He is a prophet." 
18
Now the Jews did not believe that he had been
blind and gained his sight until they summoned the parents of the one who had
gained his sight. 
19
They asked them, "Is this your son, who
you say was born blind? How does he now see?" 
20
His parents answered and said, "We know
that this is our son and that he was born blind. 
21
We do not know how he sees now, nor do we know
who opened his eyes. Ask him, he is of age; he can speak for him self." 
22
[5]
 His parents said this because they were afraid
of the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone acknowledged him as
the Messiah, he would be expelled from the synagogue. 
23
For this reason his parents said, "He is
of age; question him." 
24
So a second time they called the man who had
been blind and said to him, "Give God the praise! 
[6]
 We
know that this man is a sinner." 
25
He replied, "If he is a sinner, I do not
know. One thing I do know is that I was blind and now I see." 
26
So they said to him, "What did he do to
you? How did he open your eyes?" 
27
He answered them, "I told you already and
you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his
disciples, too?" 
28
They ridiculed him and said, "You are that
man's disciple; we are disciples of Moses! 
29
We know that God spoke to Moses, but we do not
know where this one is from." 
30
The man answered and said to them, "This
is what is so amazing, that you do not know where he is from, yet he opened my
eyes. 
31
We know that God does not listen to sinners,
but if one is devout and does his will, he listens to him. 
32
[7]
 It is unheard of that anyone ever opened the
eyes of a person born blind. 
33
If this man were not from God, he would not be
able to do anything." 
34
They answered and said to him, "You were
born totally in sin, and are you trying to teach us?" Then they threw him
out. 
35
When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out,
he found him and said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?" 
36
He answered and said, "Who is he, sir,
that I may believe in him?" 
37
Jesus said to him, "You have seen him and
the one speaking with you is he." 
38
He said, "I do believe, Lord," and he
worshiped him. 
39
[8]
 Then Jesus said, "I came into this world
for judgment, so that those who do not see might see, and those who do see
might become blind." 
40
Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard
this and said to him, "Surely we are not also blind, are we?" 
41
Jesus said to them, "If you were blind,
you would have no sin; but now you are saying, 'We see,' so your sin remains.

 10:21] Sabbath
healing of the man born blind. This sixth sign is introduced to illustrate the
saying, "I am the light of the world" (
⇒
8:12; 
⇒
 9:5). The narrative of conflict
about Jesus contrasts Jesus (light) with the Jews (blindness,
⇒
 John 9:39-41). The theme of water is reintroduced
in the reference to the pool of Siloam. Ironically, Jesus is being judged by
the Jews, yet the Jews are judged by the Light of the world; cf
⇒
 John 3:19-21.

 [2] See the note on
⇒
 John 5:14, and 
⇒
 Exodus
20:5, that parents' sins were visited upon their children. Jesus
denies such a cause and emphasizes the purpose: the infirmity was providential.

 [7] Go wash: perhaps a test of
faith; cf

 2 Kings 5:10-14. The water tunnel
Siloam (= Sent) is used as a symbol of Jesus, sent by his Father.

 [14] In using spittle, kneading
clay, and healing, Jesus had broken the sabbath rules laid down by Jewish
tradition.

 [22] This comment of the evangelist
(in terms used again in 
⇒
 John 12:42;
⇒
 John 16:2) envisages a situation after Jesus'
ministry. Rejection/excommunication from the synagogue of Jews who confessed
Jesus as Messiah seems to have begun ca. A.D. 85, when the curse against the
minim or heretics was introduced into the "Eighteen Benedictions."

 [24] Give God the praise!: an Old
Testament formula of adjuration to tell the truth; cf

 Joshua
7:19;

 1 Sam 6:5 LXX. Cf

 John 5:41.

 [32] A person born blind: the only
Old Testament cure from blindness is found in Tobit (cf 
⇒
 Tobit
7:7; 
⇒
 11:7-13; 
⇒
 14:1-2),
but Tobit was not born blind.

 [39-41] These verses spell out the
symbolic meaning of the cure; the Pharisees are not the innocent blind, willing
to accept the testimony of others.
