 When Jesus had said this,
he raised his eyes to heaven and said, "Father, the hour has come. Give
glory to your son, so that your son may glorify you, 
2
[3]
 just as you gave him authority over all
people, so that he may give eternal life to all you gave him. 
3
[4]
 Now this is eternal life, that they should
know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ. 
4
I glorified you on earth by accomplishing the
work that you gave me to do. 
5
Now glorify me, Father, with you, with the
glory that I had with you before the world began. 
6
"I revealed your name 
[5]
to those whom you gave me out of the world. They belonged to you, and you gave
them to me, and they have kept your word. 
7
Now they know that everything you gave me is
from you, 
8
because the words you gave to me I have given
to them, and they accepted them and truly understood that I came from you, and
they have believed that you sent me. 
9
I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but
for the ones you have given me, because they are yours, 
10
and everything of mine is yours and everything
of yours is mine, and I have been glorified in them. 
11
And now I will no longer be in the world, but
they are in the world, while I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your
name that you have given me, so that they may be one just as we are. 
12
When I was with them I protected them in your
name that you gave me, and I guarded them, and none of them was lost except the
son of destruction, in order that the scripture might be fulfilled. 
13
But now I am coming to you. I speak this in the
world so that they may share my joy completely. 
14
I gave them your word, and the world hated
them, because they do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the
world. 
15
[6]
 I do not ask that you take them out of the
world but that you keep them from the evil one. 
16
They do not belong to the world any more than I
belong to the world. 
17
Consecrate them in the truth. Your word is
truth. 
18
As you sent me into the world, so I sent them
into the world. 
19
And I consecrate myself for them, so that they
also may be consecrated in truth. 
20
"I pray not only for them, but also for
those who will believe in me through their word, 
21
so that they may all be one, as you, Father,
are in me and I in you, that they also may be in us, that the world may believe
that you sent me. 
22
And I have given them the glory you gave me, so
that they may be one, as we are one, 
23
I in them and you in me, that they may be
brought to perfection as one, that the world may know that you sent me, and
that you loved them even as you loved me. 
24
Father, they are your gift to me. I wish that
where I am 
[7]
 they also may be with me, that they may see my
glory that you gave me, because you loved me before the foundation of the
world. 
25
Righteous Father, the world also does not know
you, but I know you, and they know that you sent me. 
26
I made known to them your name and I will make
it known, 
[8]
 that the love with which you loved me may be in
them and I in them." 
1
 [1-26] Climax of the last
discourse(s). Since the sixteenth century, this chapter has been called the
"high priestly prayer" of Jesus. He speaks as intercessor, with words
addressed directly to the Father and not to the disciples, who supposedly only
overhear. Yet the prayer is one of petition, for immediate
(
⇒
 John 17:6-19) and future
(
⇒
 John 17:20-21) disciples. Many phrases
reminiscent of the Lord's Prayer occur. Although still in the world (
⇒
17:13), Jesus looks on his earthly ministry as a thing of the past
(
⇒
 John 17:4, 
⇒
 12).
Whereas Jesus has up to this time stated that the disciples could follow him
(
⇒
 John 13:33, 
⇒
 36),
now he wishes them to be with him in union with the Father
(
⇒
 John 17:12-14).
2
 [1] The action of looking up to
heaven and the address Father are typical of Jesus at prayer; cf
⇒
 John 11:41 and 
⇒
 Luke
11:2. 
3
 [2] Another possible interpretation
is to treat the first line of the verse as parenthetical and the second as an
appositive to the clause that ends v 1: so that your son may glorify you (just
as . . . all people), so that he may give eternal life. . . .
4
 [3] This verse was clearly added in
the editing of the gospel as a reflection on the preceding verse; Jesus nowhere
else refers to himself as Jesus Christ.
5
 [6] I revealed your name: perhaps
the name I AM; cf 
⇒
 John 8:24,
⇒
 28, 
⇒
 58;
⇒
 13:19.
6
 [15] Note the resemblance to the
petition of the Lord's Prayer, "deliver us from the evil one." Both
probably refer to the devil rather than to abstract evil.
7
 [24] Where I am: Jesus prays for
the believers ultimately to join him in heaven. Then they will not see his
glory as in a mirror but clearly (
⇒
 2 Cor 3:18;
⇒
 1 John 3:2).
8
 [26] I will make it known: through
the Advocate.
