 "I am the true vine,
and my Father is the vine grower. 
2
He takes away every branch in me that does not
bear fruit, and everyone that does he prunes 
[3]
 so that it
bears more fruit. 
3
You are already pruned because of the word that
I spoke to you. 
4
Remain in me, as I remain in you. Just as a
branch cannot bear fruit on its own unless it remains on the vine, so neither
can you unless you remain in me. 
5
I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever
remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit, because without me you can do
nothing. 
6
[4]
 Anyone who does not remain in me will be
thrown out like a branch and wither; people will gather them and throw them
into a fire and they will be burned. 
7
If you remain in me and my words remain in you,
ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you. 
8
By this is my Father glorified, that you bear
much fruit and become my disciples. 
9
As the Father loves me, so I also love you.
Remain in my love. 
10
If you keep my commandments, you will remain in
my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and remain in his love. 
11
"I have told you this so that my joy may
be in you and your joy may be complete. 
12
This is my commandment: love one another as I
love you. 
13
[5]
 No one has greater love than this, to lay down
one's life for one's friends. 
14
You are my friends if you do what I command
you. 
15
I no longer call you slaves, because a slave
does not know what his master is doing. I have called you friends, 
[6]
because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father. 
16
It was not you who chose me, but I who chose
you and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain, so that whatever
you ask the Father in my name he may give you. 
17
This I command you: love one another. 
18
[7]
 "If the world hates you, realize that it
hated me first. 
19
If you belonged to the world, the world would
love its own; but because you do not belong to the world, and I have chosen you
out of the world, the world hates you. 
20
Remember the word I spoke to you, 
[8]
'No slave is greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will also
persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours. 
21
And they will do all these things to you on
account of my name, 
[9]
 because they do not know the one who
sent me. 
22
If I had not come and spoken 
[10]
to them, they would have no sin; but as it is they have no excuse for their
sin. 
23
Whoever hates me also hates my Father. 
24
If I had not done works among them that no one
else ever did, they would not have sin; but as it is, they have seen and hated
both me and my Father. 
25
But in order that the word written in their law
[11]
 might be fulfilled, 'They hated me without cause.' 
26
"When the Advocate comes whom I will send 
[12]
you from the Father, the Spirit of truth that proceeds from the Father, he will
testify to me. 
27
And you also testify, because you have been
with me from the beginning.

on the union of Jesus with his disciples. His words become a monologue and go
beyond the immediate crisis of the departure of Jesus.

 [1-17] Like 
⇒
10:1-5, this passage resembles a parable. Israel is spoken of as a
vineyard at 
⇒
 Isaiah 5:1-7;
⇒
 Matthew 21:33-46 and as a vine at
⇒
 Psalm 80:9-17;

 Jeremiah
2:21; 
⇒
 Ezekiel 15:2;
⇒
 17:5-10;

 Hosea 10:1. The identification of the vine as the
Son of Man in 
⇒
 Psalm 80:15 and Wisdom's
description of herself as a vine in 
⇒
 Sirach 24:17
are further background for portrayal of Jesus by this figure. There may be
secondary eucharistic symbolism here; cf 
⇒
 Mark
14:25 "the fruit of the vine." 
3
 [2] Takes away . . . prunes: in Greek
there is a play on two related verbs.
4
 [6] Branches were cut off and dried
on the wall of the vineyard for later use as fuel.

 [13] For one's friends: or:
"those whom one loves." In 
⇒
15:9-13a, the words for love are related to the Greek agapao. In
⇒
 John 15:13b-15, the words for love are related to
the Greek phileo. For John, the two roots seem synonymous and mean "to
love"; cf also 
⇒
 John 21:15-17. The word
philos is used here.

 [15] Slaves . . . friends: in the
Old Testament, Moses (

 Deut 34:5), Joshua
(
⇒
 Joshua 24:29), and David
(
⇒
 Psalm 89:21) were called "servants" or
"slaves of Yahweh"; only Abraham (

 Isaiah
41:8;

 2 Chron 20:7; cf
⇒
 James 2:23) was called a "friend of
God."

The hostile reaction of the world. There are synoptic parallels, predicting
persecution, especially at

 Matthew 10:17-25;

 24:9-10.

 [20] The word I spoke to you: a

 [21] On account of my name: the
idea of persecution for Jesus' name is frequent in the New Testament
(
⇒
 Matthew 10:22; 
⇒
 24:9;
⇒
 Acts 9:14). For John, association with Jesus' name
implies union with Jesus.
10
 [22,24] Jesus' words (spoken) and
deeds )works) are the great motives of credibility. They have seen and hated:
probably means that they have seen his works and still have hated; but the
Greek can be read: "have seen both me and my Father and still have hated
both me and my Father." Works . . . that no one else ever did: so Yahweh
in 
⇒
 Deut 4:32-33.
11
 [25] In their law: law is here used
as a larger concept than the Pentateuch, for the reference is to
⇒
 Psalm 35:19 or 
⇒
 Psalm
69:5. See the notes on 
⇒
 John 10:34;

 12:34. Their law reflects the argument of the
church with the synagogue.

Paraclete is to be sent by the Father, at the request of Jesus. Here the Spirit
comes from both Jesus and the Father in mission; there is no reference here to
the eternal procession of the Spirit.
