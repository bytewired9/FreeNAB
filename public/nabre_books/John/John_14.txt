 "Do not let your hearts
be troubled. You have faith in God; have faith also in me. 
2
In my Father's house there are many dwelling
places. If there were not, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a
place for you? 
3
[3]
 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I
will come back again and take you to myself, so that where I am you also may
be. 
4
Where (I) am going you know the way." 
[4]
5
Thomas said to him, "Master, we do not
know where you are going; how can we know the way?" 
6
Jesus said to him, "I am the way and the
truth 
[5]
 and the life. No one comes to the Father except
through me. 
7
If you know me, then you will also know my
Father. 
[6]
 From now on you do know him and have seen
him." 
8
Philip said to him, "Master, show us the
Father, 
[7]
 and that will be enough for us." 
9
Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you for
so long a time and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has
seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? 
10
Do you not believe that I am in the Father and
the Father is in me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on my own.
The Father who dwells in me is doing his works. 
11
Believe me that I am in the Father and the
Father is in me, or else, believe because of the works themselves. 
12
Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever believes in
me will do the works that I do, and will do greater ones than these, because I
am going to the Father. 
13
And whatever you ask in my name, I will do, so
that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 
14
If you ask anything of me in my name, I will do
it. 
15
"If you love me, you will keep my
commandments. 
16
And I will ask the Father, and he will give you
another Advocate 
[8]
 to be with you always, 
17
the Spirit of truth, 
[9]
 which
the world cannot accept, because it neither sees nor knows it. But you know it,
because it remains with you, and will be in you. 
18
I will not leave you orphans; I will come to
you. 
[10]
19
In a little while the world will no longer see
me, but you will see me, because I live and you will live. 
20
On that day you will realize that I am in my
Father and you are in me and I in you. 
21
Whoever has my commandments and observes them
is the one who loves me. And whoever loves me will be loved by my Father, and I
will love him and reveal myself to him." 
22
Judas, not the Iscariot, 
[11]
said to him, "Master, (then) what happened that you will reveal yourself
to us and not to the world?" 
23
Jesus answered and said to him, "Whoever
loves me will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to
him and make our dwelling with him. 
24
Whoever does not love me does not keep my
words; yet the word you hear is not mine but that of the Father who sent me. 
25
"I have told you this while I am with you.
26
The Advocate, the holy Spirit that the Father
will send in my name - he will teach you everything and remind you of all that
(I) told you. 
27
Peace 
[12]
 I leave with you;
my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give it to you. Do not let
your hearts be troubled or afraid. 
28
[13]
 You heard me tell you, 'I am going away and I
will come back to you.' If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to
the Father; for the Father is greater than I. 
29
And now I have told you this before it happens,
so that when it happens you may believe. 
30
I will no longer speak much with you, for the
ruler of the world 
[14]
 is coming. He has no power over me, 
31
but the world must know that I love the Father
and that I do just as the Father has commanded me. Get up, let us go.

 [1-31] Jesus' departure and return.
This section is a dialogue marked off by a literary inclusion in
⇒
 John 14:1, 
⇒
 27:
"Do not let your hearts be troubled."
2
 [1] You have faith: could also be
imperative: "Have faith." 
3
 [3] Come back again: a rare
Johannine reference to the parousia; cf 
⇒
 1 John
2:28.
4
 [4] The way: here, of Jesus
himself; also a designation of Christianity in 
⇒
 Acts
9:2; 
⇒
 19:9,
⇒
 23; 
⇒
 22:4; 
⇒
 24:14,
⇒
 22.
5
 [6] The truth: in John, the
divinely revealed reality of the Father manifested in the person and works of
Jesus. The possession of truth confers knowledge and liberation from sin
(
⇒
 John 8:32).
6
 [7] An alternative reading,
"If you knew me, then you would have known my Father also," would be
a rebuke, as in 
⇒
 John 8:19.
7
 [8] Show us the Father: Philip is pictured
asking for a theophany like 
⇒
 Exodus 24:9-10;
⇒
 33:18.
8
 [16] Another Advocate: Jesus is the
first advocate (paraclete); see 
⇒
 1 John 2:1, where
Jesus is an advocate in the sense of intercessor in heaven. The Greek term
derives from legal terminology for an advocate or defense attorney, and can
mean spokesman, mediator, intercessor, comforter, consoler, although no one of
these terms encompasses the meaning in John. The Paraclete in John is a
teacher, a witness to Jesus, and a prosecutor of the world, who represents the
continued presence on earth of the Jesus who has returned to the Father.
9
 [17] The Spirit of truth: this term
is also used at Qumran, where it is a moral force put into a person by God, as
opposed to the spirit of perversity. It is more personal in John; it will teach
the realities of the new order (
⇒
 John 14:26), and
testify to the truth (
⇒
 John 14:6). While it has
been customary to use masculine personal pronouns in English for the Advocate,
the Greek word for "spirit" is neuter, and the Greek text and
manuscript variants fluctuate between masculine and neuter pronouns.
10
 [18] I will come to you:
indwelling, not parousia.
11
 [22] Judas, not the Iscariot:
probably not the brother of Jesus in 
⇒
 Mark 6:3 //
⇒
 Matthew 13:55 or the apostle named Jude in
⇒
 Luke 6:16 but Thomas (see the note on
⇒
 John 11:16), although other readings have
"Judas the Cananean."
12
 [27] Peace: the traditional Hebrew
salutation salom; but Jesus' "Shalom" is a gift of salvation,
connoting the bounty of messianic blessing.
13
 [28] The Father is greater than I:
because he sent, gave, etc., and Jesus is "a man who has told you the
truth that I heard from God" (
⇒
 John 8:40).
14
 [30] The ruler of the world: Satan;
cf 
⇒
 John 12:31;
⇒
 16:11.
