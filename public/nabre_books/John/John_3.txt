[1]
 Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, a
ruler of the Jews. 
[2]
2
He came to Jesus at night and said to him,
"Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one
can do these signs that you are doing unless God is with him." 
3
Jesus answered and said to him, "Amen,
amen, I say to you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born 
[3]
from above." 
4
Nicodemus said to him, "How can a person once
grown old be born again? Surely he cannot reenter his mother's womb and be born
again, can he?" 
5
Jesus answered, "Amen, amen, I say to you,
no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit. 
6
What is born of flesh is flesh and what is born
of spirit is spirit. 
7
Do not be amazed that I told you, 'You must be
born from above.' 
8
The wind 
[4]
 blows where it
wills, and you can hear the sound it makes, but you do not know where it comes
from or where it goes; so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit." 
9
Nicodemus answered and said to him, "How
can this happen?" 
10
Jesus answered and said to him, "You are
the teacher of Israel and you do not understand this? 
11
Amen, amen, I say to you, we speak of what we
know and we testify to what we have seen, but you people do not accept our
testimony. 
12
If I tell you about earthly things and you do
not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? 
13
No one has gone up to heaven except the one who
has come down from heaven, the Son of Man. 
14
And just as Moses lifted up 
[5]
the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 
15
[6]
 so that everyone who believes in him may have
eternal life." 
16
For God so loved the world that he gave 
[7]
his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might
have eternal life. 
17
For God did not send his Son into the world to
condemn 
[8]
 the world, but that the world might be saved
through him. 
18
Whoever believes in him will not be condemned,
but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not
believed in the name of the only Son of God. 
19
[9]
 And this is the verdict, that the light came
into the world, but people preferred darkness to light, because their works
were evil. 
20
For everyone who does wicked things hates the
light and does not come toward the light, so that his works might not be
exposed. 
21
But whoever lives the truth comes to the light,
so that his works may be clearly seen as done in God. 
22
[10]
 After this, Jesus and his disciples went into
the region of Judea, where he spent some time with them baptizing. 
23
John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim, 
[11]
because there was an abundance of water there, and people came to be baptized, 
24
[12]
 for John had not yet been imprisoned. 
25
Now a dispute arose between the disciples of
John and a Jew 
[13]
 about ceremonial washings. 
26
So they came to John and said to him,
"Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you testified,
here he is baptizing and everyone is coming to him." 
27
John answered and said, "No one can
receive anything except what has been given him from heaven. 
28
You yourselves can testify that I said (that) I
am not the Messiah, but that I was sent before him. 
29
The one who has the bride is the bridegroom;
the best man, 
[14]
 who stands and listens for him, rejoices
greatly at the bridegroom's voice. So this joy of mine has been made complete. 
30
He must increase; I must decrease." 
31
[15]
 The one who comes from above is above all. The
one who is of the earth is earthly and speaks of earthly things. But the one
who comes from heaven (is above all). 
32
He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but
no one accepts his testimony. 
33
Whoever does accept his testimony certifies
that God is trustworthy. 
34
For the one whom God sent speaks the words of
God. He does not ration his gift 
[16]
 of the Spirit. 
35
The Father loves the Son and has given
everything over to him. 
36
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life,
but whoever disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains
upon him. 
1
 [1-21] Jesus instructs Nicodemus on
the necessity of a new birth from above. This scene in Jerusalem at Passover
exemplifies the faith engendered by signs (
⇒
2:23). It continues the self-manifestation of Jesus in Jerusalem
begun in John 2. This is the first of the Johannine discourses, shifting from
dialogue to monologue (
⇒
 John 3:11-15) to reflection
of the evangelist (
⇒
 John 3:16-21). The shift from
singular through 
⇒
 John 3:10 to plural in
⇒
 John 3:11 may reflect the early church's
controversy with the Jews.
2
 [1] A ruler of the Jews: most
likely a member of the Jewish council, the Sanhedrin; see the note on
⇒
 Mark 8:31. 
3
 [3] Born: see the note on 
⇒
1:13. From above: the Greek adverb anothen means both "from
above" and "again." Jesus means "from above" (see
⇒
 John 3:31) but Nicodemus misunderstands it as "again."
This misunderstanding serves as a springboard for further instruction.
4
 [8] Wind: the Greek word pneuma (as
well as the Hebrew ruah) means both "wind" and "spirit." In
the play on the double meaning, "wind" is primary.
5
 [14] Lifted up: in
⇒
 Numbers 21:9 Moses simply "mounted" a
serpent upon a pole. John here substitutes a verb implying glorification.
Jesus, exalted to glory at his cross and resurrection, represents healing for
all.
6
 [15] Eternal life: used here for
the first time in John, this term stresses quality of life rather than
duration.
7
 [16] Gave: as a gift in the
incarnation, and also "over to death" in the crucifixion; cf
⇒
 Romans 8:32.
8
 [17-19] Condemn: the Greek root
means both judgment and condemnation. Jesus' purpose is to save, but his coming
provokes judgment; some condemn themselves by turning from the light.
9
 [19] Judgment is not only future
but is partially realized here and now.
10
 [22-26] Jesus' ministry in Judea is
only loosely connected with 
⇒
2:13-
⇒
 3:21; cf 
⇒
1:19-36. Perhaps John the Baptist's further testimony was transposed
here to give meaning to "water" in 
⇒
3:5. Jesus is depicted as baptizing (
⇒
3:22); contrast 
⇒
 John 4:2.
11
 [23] Aenon near Salim: site
uncertain, either in the upper Jordan valley or in Samaria.
12
 [24] A remark probably intended to
avoid objections based on a chronology like that of the synoptics
(
⇒
 Matthew 4:12; 
⇒
 Mark
1:14).
13
 [25] A Jew: some think Jesus is
meant. Many manuscripts read "Jews."
14
 [29] The best man: literally,
"the friend of the groom," the shoshben of Jewish tradition, who
arranged the wedding. Competition between him and the groom would be
unthinkable.
15
 [31-36] It is uncertain whether
these are words by the Baptist, Jesus, or the evangelist. They are reflections
on the two preceding scenes.
16
 [34] His gift: of God or to Jesus,
perhaps both. This verse echoes 
⇒
 John 5:8.
