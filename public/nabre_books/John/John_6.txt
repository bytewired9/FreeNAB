[2]
 After this, Jesus went
across the Sea of Galilee (of Tiberias). 
2
A large crowd followed him, because they saw
the signs he was performing on the sick. 
3
Jesus went up on the mountain, and there he sat
down with his disciples. 
4
The Jewish feast of Passover was near. 
5
[3]
 When Jesus raised his eyes and saw that a
large crowd was coming to him, he said to Philip, "Where can we buy enough
food for them to eat?" 
6
[4]
 He said this to test him, because he himself
knew what he was going to do. 
7
Philip answered him, "Two hundred days'
wages 
[5]
 worth of food would not be enough for each of them
to have a little (bit)." 
8
One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of
Simon Peter, said to him, 
9
"There is a boy here who has five barley
loaves 
[6]
 and two fish; but what good are these for so
many?" 
10
Jesus said, "Have the people
recline." Now there was a great deal of grass 
[7]
 in that
place. So the men reclined, about five thousand in number. 
11
Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and
distributed them to those who were reclining, and also as much of the fish as
they wanted. 
12
When they had had their fill, he said to his
disciples, "Gather the fragments left over, so that nothing will be
wasted." 
13
So they collected them, and filled twelve
wicker baskets 
[8]
 with fragments from the five barley loaves
that had been more than they could eat. 
14
When the people saw the sign he had done, they
said, "This is truly the Prophet, 
[9]
 the one who is to come
into the world." 
15
Since Jesus knew that they were going to come
and carry him off to make him king, he withdrew again to the mountain alone. 
16
[10]
 When it was evening, his disciples went down
to the sea, 
17
embarked in a boat, and went across the sea to
Capernaum. It had already grown dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. 
18
The sea was stirred up because a strong wind
was blowing. 
19
When they had rowed about three or four miles,
they saw Jesus walking on the sea 
[11]
 and coming near the
boat, and they began to be afraid. 
20
But he said to them, "It is I. 
[12]
Do not be afraid." 
21
They wanted to take him into the boat, but the
boat immediately arrived at the shore to which they were heading. 
22
[13]
 The next day, the crowd that remained across
the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not gone
along with his disciples in the boat, but only his disciples had left. 
23
[14]
 Other boats came from Tiberias near the place
where they had eaten the bread when the Lord gave thanks. 
24
When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his
disciples were there, they themselves got into boats and came to Capernaum
looking for Jesus. 
25
And when they found him across the sea they
said to him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?" 
26
Jesus answered them and said, "Amen, amen,
I say to you, you are looking for me not because you saw signs but because you
ate the loaves and were filled. 
27
Do not work for food that perishes but for the
food that endures for eternal life, 
[15]
 which the Son of Man
will give you. For on him the Father, God, has set his seal." 
28
So they said to him, "What can we do to
accomplish the works of God?" 
29
Jesus answered and said to them, "This is the
work of God, that you believe in the one he sent." 
30
So they said to him, "What sign can you
do, that we may see and believe in you? What can you do? 
31
[16]
 Our ancestors ate manna in the desert, as it
is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'" 
32
So Jesus said to them, "Amen, amen, I say
to you, it was not Moses who gave the bread from heaven; my Father gives you
the true bread from heaven. 
33
For the bread of God is that which comes down
from heaven and gives life to the world." 
34
So they said to him, "Sir, give us this
bread always." 
35
[17]
 Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of
life; whoever comes to me will never hunger, and whoever believes in me will
never thirst. 
36
But I told you that although you have seen
(me), you do not believe. 
37
Everything that the Father gives me will come
to me, and I will not reject anyone who comes to me, 
38
because I came down from heaven not to do my
own will but the will of the one who sent me. 
39
And this is the will of the one who sent me,
that I should not lose anything of what he gave me, but that I should raise it
(on) the last day. 
40
For this is the will of my Father, that
everyone who sees the Son and believes in him may have eternal life, and I
shall raise him (on) the last day." 
41
The Jews murmured about him because he said,
"I am the bread that came down from heaven," 
42
and they said, "Is this not Jesus, the son
of Joseph? Do we not know his father and mother? Then how can he say, 'I have
come down from heaven'?" 
43
Jesus answered and said to them, "Stop
murmuring 
[18]
 among yourselves. 
44
No one can come to me unless the Father who
sent me draw him, and I will raise him on the last day. 
45
It is written in the prophets: 'They shall all
be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to my Father and learns from him comes
to me. 
46
Not that anyone has seen the Father except the
one who is from God; he has seen the Father. 
47
Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever believes has
eternal life. 
48
I am the bread of life. 
49
Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, but
they died; 
50
this is the bread that comes down from heaven
so that one may eat it and not die. 
51
I am the living bread that came down from
heaven; whoever eats this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will
give is my flesh for the life of the world." 
52
The Jews quarreled among themselves, saying,
"How can this man give us (his) flesh to eat?" 
53
Jesus said to them, "Amen, amen, I say to
you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not
have life within you. 
54
Whoever eats 
[19]
 my flesh and
drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day. 
55
For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true
drink. 
56
Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood
remains in me and I in him. 
57
Just as the living Father sent me and I have
life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life
because of me. 
58
This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike
your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live
forever." 
59
These things he said while teaching in the
synagogue in Capernaum. 
60
[20]
 Then many of his disciples who were listening
said, "This saying is hard; who can accept it?" 
61
Since Jesus knew that his disciples were
murmuring about this, he said to them, "Does this shock you? 
62
What if you were to see the Son of Man
ascending to where he was before? 
[21]
63
It is the spirit that gives life, while the
flesh 
[22]
 is of no avail. The words I have spoken to you are
spirit and life. 
64
But there are some of you who do not
believe." Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe and
the one who would betray him. 
65
And he said, "For this reason I have told
you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father." 
66
As a result of this, many (of) his disciples
returned to their former way of life and no longer accompanied him. 
67
Jesus then said to the Twelve, "Do you
also want to leave?" 
68
Simon Peter answered him, "Master, to whom
shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. 
69
We have come to believe and are convinced that
you are the Holy One of God." 
70
Jesus answered them, "Did I not choose you
twelve? Yet is not one of you a devil?" 
71
He was referring to Judas, son of Simon the
Iscariot; it was he who would betray him, one of the Twelve.

 [1] [Of Tiberias]: the awkward
apposition represents a later name of the Sea of Galilee. It was probably
originally a marginal gloss.
2
 [1-15] This story of the
multiplication of the loaves is the fourth sign (cf the note on
⇒
 John 5:1-47). It is the only miracle story found in
all four gospels (occurring twice in Mark and Matthew). See the notes on
⇒
 Matthew 14:13-21;
⇒
 15:32-39. John differs on the roles of Philip and
Andrew, the proximity of Passover (
⇒
 John 6:4), and
the allusion to Elisha (see 
⇒
 John 6:9). The story
here symbolizes the food that is really available through Jesus. It connotes a
new exodus and has eucharistic overtones. 
3
 [5] Jesus takes the initiative (in
the synoptics, the disciples do), possibly pictured as (cf 
⇒
6:14) the new Moses (cf 
⇒
 Numbers 11:13).
4
 [6] Probably the evangelist's
comment; in this gospel Jesus is never portrayed as ignorant of anything.
5
 [7] Days' wages: literally,
"denarii"; a Roman denarius is a day's wage in
⇒
 Matthew 20:2.
6
 [9] Barley loaves: the food of the
poor. There seems an allusion to the story of Elisha multiplying the barley
bread in 
⇒
 2 Kings 4:42-44.
7
 [10] Grass: implies springtime, and
therefore Passover. Five thousand: so 
⇒
 Mark 6:39,
⇒
 44 and parallels.
8
 [13] Baskets: the word describes the
typically Palestinian wicker basket, as in 
⇒
 Mark
6:43 and parallels.
9
 [14] The Prophet: probably the
prophet like Moses (see the note on 
⇒
 John 1:21).
The one who is to come into the world: probably Elijah; cf
⇒
 Malachi 3:1, 
⇒
 23.
10
 [16-21] The fifth sign is a nature
miracle, portraying Jesus sharing Yahweh's power. Cf the parallel stories
following the multiplication of the loaves in 
⇒
 Mark
6:45-52 and 
⇒
 Matthew 14:22-33.
11
 [19] Walking on the sea: although
the Greek (cf 
⇒
 John 6:16) could mean "on the
seashore" or "by the sea" (cf 
⇒
21:1), the parallels, especially 
⇒
 Matthew
14:25, make clear that Jesus walked upon the water. John may allude
to 
⇒
 Job 9:8: God "treads upon the crests of the
sea."
12
 [20] It is I: literally, "I
am." See also the notes on 
⇒
 John 4:26 and
⇒
 Mark 6:50.
13
 [22-71] Discourse on the bread of
life; replacement of the manna. 
⇒
 John 6:22-34 serve
as an introduction, 
⇒
 John 6:35-59 constitute the
discourse proper, 
⇒
 John 6:60-71 portray the
reaction of the disciples and Peter's confession.
14
 [23] Possibly a later interpolation,
to explain how the crowd got to Capernaum.
15
 [27] The food that endures for
eternal life: cf 
⇒
 John 4:14, on water
"springing up to eternal life."
16
 [31] Bread from heaven: cf
⇒
 Exodus 16:4, 
⇒
 15,
⇒
 32-34 and the notes there;
⇒
 Psalm 78:24. The manna, thought to have been
hidden by Jeremiah (
⇒
 2 Macc 2:5-8), was expected to
reappear miraculously at Passover, in the last days.
17
 [35-59] Up to
⇒
 John 6:50 "bread of life" is a figure
for God's revelation in Jesus; in 
⇒
 John 6:51-58,
the eucharistic theme comes to the fore. There may thus be a break between
⇒
 John 6:50-51.
18
 [43] Murmuring: the word may
reflect the Greek of 
⇒
 Exodus 16:2,
⇒
 7-8.
19
 [54-58] Eats: the verb used in
these verses is not the classical Greek verb used of human eating, but that of
animal eating: "munch," "gnaw." This may be part of John's
emphasis on the reality of the flesh and blood of Jesus (cf 
⇒
6:55), but the same verb eventually became the ordinary verb in Greek
meaning "eat."
20
 [60-71] These verses refer more to
themes of 
⇒
 John 6:35-50 than to those of
⇒
 John 6:51-58 and seem to be addressed to members
of the Johannine community who found it difficult to accept the high
christology reflected in the bread of life discourse.
21
 [62] This unfinished conditional
sentence is obscure. Probably there is a reference to 
⇒
6:49-51. Jesus claims to be the bread that comes down from heaven
(
⇒
 John 6:50); this claim provokes incredulity
(
⇒
 John 6:60); and so Jesus is pictured as asking
what his disciples will say when he goes up to heaven.
22
 [63] Spirit . . . flesh: probably
not a reference to the eucharistic body of Jesus but to the supernatural and
the natural, as in 
⇒
 John 3:6. Spirit and life: all
Jesus said about the bread of life is the revelation of the Spirit.
