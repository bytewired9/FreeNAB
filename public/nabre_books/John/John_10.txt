[2]
 "Amen, amen, I say
to you, whoever does not enter a sheepfold through the gate but climbs over
elsewhere is a thief and a robber. 
2
But whoever enters through the gate is the
shepherd of the sheep. 
3
The gatekeeper opens it for him, and the sheep
hear his voice, as he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 
4
[3]
 When he has driven out all his own, he walks
ahead of them, and the sheep follow him, because they recognize his voice. 
5
But they will not follow a stranger; they will
run away from him, because they do not recognize the voice of strangers." 
6
Although Jesus used this figure of speech, 
[4]
they did not realize what he was trying to tell them. 
7
[5]
 So Jesus said again, "Amen, amen, I say
to you, I am the gate for the sheep. 
8
[6]
 All who came [before me] are thieves and robbers,
but the sheep did not listen to them. 
9
I am the gate. Whoever enters through me will
be saved, and will come in and go out and find pasture. 
10
A thief comes only to steal and slaughter and
destroy; I came so that they might have life and have it more abundantly. 
11
I am the good shepherd. A good shepherd lays
down his life for the sheep. 
12
A hired man, who is not a shepherd and whose
sheep are not his own, sees a wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away,
and the wolf catches and scatters them. 
13
This is because he works for pay and has no
concern for the sheep. 
14
I am the good shepherd, and I know mine and
mine know me, 
15
just as the Father knows me and I know the
Father; and I will lay down my life for the sheep. 
16
I have other sheep 
[7]
 that do
not belong to this fold. These also I must lead, and they will hear my voice,
and there will be one flock, one shepherd. 
17
This is why the Father loves me, because I lay
down my life in order to take it up again. 
18
No one takes it from me, but I lay it down on
my own. I have power to lay it down, and power to take it up again. 
[8]
This command I have received from my Father." 
19
Again there was a division among the Jews
because of these words. 
20
Many of them said, "He is possessed and
out of his mind; why listen to him?" 
21
Others said, "These are not the words of
one possessed; surely a demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can he?" 
22
The feast of the Dedication 
[9]
was then taking place in Jerusalem. It was winter. 
23
[10]
 And Jesus walked about in the temple area on
the Portico of Solomon. 
24
So the Jews gathered around him and said to
him, "How long are you going to keep us in suspense? 
[11]
If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly." 
25
Jesus answered them, "I told you 
[12]
and you do not believe. The works I do in my Father's name testify to me. 
26
But you do not believe, because you are not
among my sheep. 
27
My sheep hear my voice; I know them, and they
follow me. 
28
I give them eternal life, and they shall never
perish. No one can take them out of my hand. 
29
My Father, who has given them to me, is greater
than all, 
[13]
 and no one can take them out of the Father's
hand. 
30
[14]
 The Father and I are one." 
31
The Jews again picked up rocks to stone him. 
32
Jesus answered them, "I have shown you
many good works from my Father. For which of these are you trying to stone
me?" 
33
The Jews answered him, "We are not stoning
you for a good work but for blasphemy. You, a man, are making yourself
God." 
34
[15]
 Jesus answered them, "Is it not written
in your law, 'I said, "You are gods"'? 
35
If it calls them gods to whom the word of God
came, and scripture cannot be set aside, 
36
can you say that the one whom the Father has
consecrated 
[16]
 and sent into the world blasphemes because I
said, 'I am the Son of God'? 
37
If I do not perform my Father's works, do not
believe me; 
38
but if I perform them, even if you do not
believe me, believe the works, so that you may realize (and understand) that
the Father is in me and I am in the Father." 
39
(Then) they tried again to arrest him; but he
escaped from their power. 
40
He went back across the Jordan to the place
where John first baptized, and there he remained. 
41
Many came to him and said, "John performed
no sign, 
[17]
 but everything John said about this man was
true." 
42
And many there began to believe in him.

 [1-21] The good shepherd discourse
continues the theme of attack on the Pharisees that ends John 9. The figure is
allegorical: the hired hands are the Pharisees who excommunicated the cured
blind man. It serves as a commentary on John 9. For the shepherd motif, used of
Yahweh in the Old Testament, cf Exodus 34; 
⇒
 Genesis
48:15; 
⇒
 49:24; 
⇒
 Micah
7:14; 
⇒
 Psalm 23:1-4;
⇒
 80:1.
2
 [1] Sheepfold: a low stone wall
open to the sky. 
3
 [4] Recognize his voice: the
Pharisees do not recognize Jesus, but the people of God, symbolized by the
blind man, do.
4
 [6] Figure of speech: John uses a
different word for illustrative speech than the "parable" of the
synoptics, but the idea is similar.
5
 [7-10] In 
⇒
10:7-8, the figure is of a gate for the shepherd to come to the
sheep; in 
⇒
 John 10:9-10, the figure is of a gate
for the sheep to come in and go out.
6
 [8] [Before me]: these words are
omitted in many good early manuscripts and versions.
7
 [16] Other sheep: the Gentiles,
possibly a reference to "God's dispersed children" of
⇒
 John 11:52 destined to be gathered into one, or
"apostolic Christians" at odds with the community of the beloved
disciple.
8
 [18] Power to take it up again:
contrast the role of the Father as the efficient cause of the resurrection in
⇒
 Acts 2:24; 
⇒
 4:10;
etc.; 
⇒
 Romans 1:4;
⇒
 4:24. Yet even here is added: This command I have
received from my Father.
9
 [22] Feast of the Dedication: an
eight-day festival of lights (Hebrew, Hanukkah) held in December, three months
after the feast of Tabernacles (
⇒
 John 7:2), to
celebrate the Maccabees' rededication of the altar and reconsecration of the
temple in 164 B.C., after their desecration by Antiochus IV Epiphanes
(
⇒
 Daniel 8:13; 
⇒
 9:27;
cf 
⇒
 1 Macc 4:36-59; 
⇒
 2 Macc
1:18-
⇒
 2:19; 
⇒
 10:1-8).
10
 [23] Portico of Solomon: on the
east side of the temple area, offering protection against the cold winds from
the desert.
11
 [24] Keep us in suspense:
literally, "How long will you take away our life?" Cf
⇒
 John 11:48-50. If you are the Messiah, tell us
plainly: cf 
⇒
 Luke 22:67. This is the climax of
Jesus' encounters with the Jewish authorities. There has never yet been an open
confession before them.
12
 [25] I told you: probably at
⇒
 John 8:25 which was an evasive answer.
13
 [29] The textual evidence for the
first clause is very divided; it may also be translated: "As for the
Father, what he has given me is greater than all," or "My Father is
greater than all, in what he has given me."
14
 [30] This is justification for
⇒
 John 10:29; it asserts unity of power and reveals
that the words and deeds of Jesus are the words and deeds of God.
15
 [34] This is a reference to the
judges of Israel who,since they exercised the divine prerogative to judge
(
⇒
 Deut 1:17), were called "gods"; cf
⇒
 Exodus 21:6, besides 
⇒
 Psalm
82:6 from which the quotation comes.
16
 [36] Consecrated: this may be a
reference to the rededicated altar at the Hanukkah feast; see the note on
⇒
 John 10:22.
17
 [41] Performed no sign: this is to
stress the inferior role of John the Baptist. The Transjordan topography
recalls the great witness of John the Baptist to Jesus, as opposed to the
hostility of the authorities in Jerusalem.
