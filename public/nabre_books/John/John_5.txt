[2]
 After this, there was a
feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
2
Now there is in Jerusalem at the Sheep (Gate) 
[3]
a pool called in Hebrew Bethesda, with five porticoes. 
3
In these lay a large number of ill, blind,
lame, and crippled. 
[4]
4
[5]
5
One man was there who had been ill for
thirty-eight years. 
6
When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he
had been ill for a long time, he said to him, "Do you want to be
well?" 
7
The sick man answered him, "Sir, I have no
one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; while I am on my way,
someone else gets down there before me." 
8
Jesus said to him, "Rise, take up your
mat, and walk." 
9
Immediately the man became well, took up his mat,
and walked. Now that day was a sabbath. 
10
So the Jews said to the man who was cured,
"It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry your mat." 
11
He answered them, "The man who made me
well told me, 'Take up your mat and walk.'" 
12
They asked him, "Who is the man who told
you, 'Take it up and walk'?" 
13
The man who was healed did not know who it was,
for Jesus had slipped away, since there was a crowd there. 
14
[6]
 After this Jesus found him in the temple area
and said to him, "Look, you are well; do not sin any more, so that nothing
worse may happen to you." 
15
The man went and told the Jews that Jesus was
the one who had made him well. 
16
Therefore, the Jews began to persecute Jesus
because he did this on a sabbath. 
17
[7]
 But Jesus answered them, "My Father is at
work until now, so I am at work." 
18
For this reason the Jews tried all the more to
kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath but he also called God his own
father, making himself equal to God. 
19
[8]
 Jesus answered and said to them, "Amen,
amen, I say to you, a son cannot do anything on his own, but only what he sees
his father doing; for what he does, his son will do also. 
20
For the Father loves his Son and shows him
everything that he himself does, and he will show him greater works than these,
so that you may be amazed. 
21
For just as the Father raises the dead and
gives life, 
[9]
 so also does the Son give life to whomever he
wishes. 
22
Nor does the Father judge anyone, but he has
given all judgment 
[10]
 to his Son, 
23
so that all may honor the Son just as they
honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who
sent him. 
24
Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever hears my word
and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life and will not come to
condemnation, but has passed from death to life. 
25
Amen, amen, I say to you, the hour is coming
and is now here when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those
who hear will live. 
26
For just as the Father has life in himself, so
also he gave to his Son the possession of life in himself. 
27
And he gave him power to exercise judgment,
because he is the Son of Man. 
28
[11]
 Do not be amazed at this, because the hour is
coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice 
29
and will come out, those who have done good
deeds to the resurrection of life, but those who have done wicked deeds to the
resurrection of condemnation. 
30
"I cannot do anything on my own; I judge
as I hear, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will but the
will of the one who sent me. 
31
"If I testify on my own behalf, my
testimony cannot be verified. 
32
But there is another 
[12]
 who
testifies on my behalf, and I know that the testimony he gives on my behalf is
true. 
33
You sent emissaries to John, and he testified
to the truth. 
34
I do not accept testimony from a human being,
but I say this so that you may be saved. 
35
He was a burning and shining lamp, 
[13]
and for a while you were content to rejoice in his light. 
36
But I have testimony greater than John's. The
works that the Father gave me to accomplish, these works that I perform testify
on my behalf that the Father has sent me. 
37
Moreover, the Father who sent me has testified
on my behalf. But you have never heard his voice nor seen his form, 
38
and you do not have his word remaining in you,
because you do not believe in the one whom he has sent. 
39
You search 
[14]
 the
scriptures, because you think you have eternal life through them; even they
testify on my behalf. 
40
But you do not want to come to me to have life.
41
"I do not accept human praise; 
[15]
42
moreover, I know that you do not have the love
of God in you. 
43
I came in the name of my Father, but you do not
accept me; yet if another comes in his own name, you will accept him. 
44
How can you believe, when you accept praise
from one another and do not seek the praise that comes from the only God? 
45
Do not think that I will accuse you before the
Father: the one who will accuse you is Moses, in whom you have placed your
hope. 
46
For if you had believed Moses, you would have
believed me, because he wrote about me. 
47
But if you do not believe his writings, how
will you believe my words?"

 [1-47] The self-revelation of Jesus
continues in Jerusalem at a feast. The third sign (cf 
⇒
2:11; 
⇒
 4:54) is performed, the cure of a
paralytic by Jesus' life-giving word. The water of the pool fails to bring
life; Jesus' word does.
2
 [1] The reference in
⇒
 John 5:45-46 to Moses suggests that the feast was
Pentecost. The connection of that feast with the giving of the law to Moses on
Sinai, attested in later Judaism, may already have been made in the first
century. The feast could also be Passover (cf 
⇒
6:4). John stresses that the day was a sabbath
(
⇒
 John 5:9). 
3
 [2] There is no noun with Sheep.
"Gate" is supplied on the grounds that there must have been a gate in
the NE wall of the temple area where animals for sacrifice were brought in; cf
⇒
 Nehemiah 3:1, 
⇒
 32;
⇒
 12:39. Hebrew: more precisely, Aramaic. Bethesda:
preferred to variants "Be(th)zatha" and "Bethsaida";
bet-esdatayin is given as the name of a double pool northeast of the temple
area in the Qumran Copper Roll. Five porticoes: a pool excavated in Jerusalem
actually has five porticoes.
4
 [3] The Caesarean and Western
recensions, followed by the Vulgate, add "waiting for the movement of the
water." Apparently an intermittent spring in the pool bubbled up
occasionally (see 
⇒
 John 5:7). This turbulence was
believed to cure.
5
 [4] Toward the end of the second
century in the West and among the fourth-century Greek Fathers, an additional
verse was known: "For [from time to time] an angel of the Lord used to
come down into the pool; and the water was stirred up, so the first one to get
in [after the stirring of the water] was healed of whatever disease afflicted
him." The angel was a popular explanation of the turbulence and the
healing powers attributed to it. This verse is missing from all early Greek
manuscripts and the earliest versions, including the original Vulgate. Its
vocabulary is markedly non-Johannine.
6
 [14] While the cure of the
paralytic in 
⇒
 Mark 2:1-12 is associated with the
forgiveness of sins, Jesus never drew a one-to-one connection between sin and
suffering (cf 
⇒
 John 9:3; 
⇒
 Luke 12:1-5),
as did 
⇒
 Ezekiel 18:20.
7
 [17] Sabbath observance (10) was
based on God's resting on the seventh day (cf 
⇒
 Genesis
2:2-3; 
⇒
 Exodus 20:11). Philo and some
rabbis insisted that God's providence remains active on the sabbath, keeping
all things in existence, giving life in birth and taking it away in death.
Other rabbis taught that God rested from creating, but not from judging
(=ruling, governing). Jesus here claims the same authority to work as the
Father, and, in the discourse that follows, the same divine prerogatives: power
over life and death (
⇒
 John 5:21,
⇒
 24-26) and judgment (
⇒
5:22, 
⇒
 27).
8
 [19] This proverb or parable is
taken from apprenticeship in a trade: the activity of a son is modeled on that
of his father. Jesus' dependence on the Father is justification for doing what
the Father does.
9
 [21] Gives life: in the Old
Testament, a divine prerogative (
⇒
 Deut 32:39;
⇒
 1 Sam 2:6; 
⇒
 2 Kings
5:7; 
⇒
 Tobit 13:2; 
⇒
 Isaiah
26:19; 
⇒
 Daniel 12:2).
10
 [22] Judgment: another divine
prerogative, often expressed as acquittal or condemnation
(
⇒
 Deut 32:36; 
⇒
 Psalm 43:1).
11
 [28-29] While
⇒
 John 5:19-27 present realized eschatology,
⇒
 John 5:28-29 are future eschatology; cf
⇒
 Daniel 12:2.
12
 [32] Another: likely the Father,
who in four different ways gives testimony to Jesus, as indicated in the verse
groupings 
⇒
 John 5:33-34,
⇒
 36, 
⇒
 37-38,
⇒
 39-40.
13
 [35] Lamp: cf
⇒
 Psalm 132:17 - "I will place a lamp for my
anointed (= David)," and possibly the description of Elijah in
⇒
 Sirach 48:1. But only for a while, indicating the
temporary and subordinate nature of John's mission.
14
 [39] You search: this may be an
imperative: "Search the scriptures, because you think that you have
eternal life through them."
15
 [41] Praise: the same Greek word
means "praise" or "honor" (from others) and
"glory" (from God). There is a play on this in
⇒
 John 5:44.
