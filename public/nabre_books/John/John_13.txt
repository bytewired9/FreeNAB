[3]
Before the feast of Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come to pass from
this world to the Father. He loved his own in the world and he loved them to
the end. 
2
The devil had already induced 
[4]
Judas, son of Simon the Iscariot, to hand him over. So, during supper, 
3
fully aware that the Father had put everything
into his power and that he had come from God and was returning to God, 
4
he rose from supper and took off his outer
garments. He took a towel and tied it around his waist. 
5
[5]
 Then he poured water into a basin and began to
wash the disciples' feet and dry them with the towel around his waist. 
6
He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Master,
are you going to wash my feet?" 
7
Jesus answered and said to him, "What I am
doing, you do not understand now, but you will understand later." 
8
Peter said to him, "You will never wash my
feet." Jesus answered him, "Unless I wash you, you will have no
inheritance with me." 
9
Simon Peter said to him, "Master, then not
only my feet, but my hands and head as well." 
10
Jesus said to him, "Whoever has bathed 
[6]
has no need except to have his feet washed, for he is clean all over; so you
are clean, but not all." 
11
For he knew who would betray him; for this
reason, he said, "Not all of you are clean." 
12
So when he had washed their feet (and) put his
garments back on and reclined at table again, he said to them, "Do you
realize what I have done for you? 
13
You call me 'teacher' and 'master,' and rightly
so, for indeed I am. 
14
If I, therefore, the master and teacher, have
washed your feet, you ought to wash one another's feet. 
15
I have given you a model to follow, so that as
I have done for you, you should also do. 
16
Amen, amen, I say to you, no slave is greater
than his master nor any messenger 
[7]
 greater than the one who
sent him. 
17
If you understand this, blessed are you if you
do it. 
18
I am not speaking of all of you. I know those
whom I have chosen. But so that the scripture might be fulfilled, 'The one who
ate my food has raised his heel against me.' 
19
From now on I am telling you before it happens,
so that when it happens you may believe that I AM. 
20
Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever receives the
one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent
me." 
21
When he had said this, Jesus was deeply
troubled and testified, "Amen, amen, I say to you, one of you will betray
me." 
22
The disciples looked at one another, at a loss
as to whom he meant. 
23
One of his disciples, the one whom Jesus loved,
[8]
 was reclining at Jesus' side. 
24
So Simon Peter nodded to him to find out whom
he meant. 
25
He leaned back against Jesus' chest and said to
him, "Master, who is it?" 
26
Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I
hand the morsel 
[9]
 after I have dipped it." So he dipped
the morsel and (took it and) handed it to Judas, son of Simon the Iscariot. 
27
After he took the morsel, Satan entered him. So
Jesus said to him, "What you are going to do, do quickly." 
28
(Now) none of those reclining at table realized
why he said this to him. 
29
Some thought that since Judas kept the money
bag, Jesus had told him, "Buy what we need for the feast," or to give
something to the poor. 
30
So he took the morsel and left at once. And it
was night. 
31
[10]
[11]
 When he had left, Jesus
said, "Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 
32
(If God is glorified in him,) God will also
glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him at once. 
33
My children, I will be with you only a little
while longer. You will look for me, and as I told the Jews, 'Where I go you
cannot come,' so now I say it to you. 
34
I give you a new commandment: 
[12]
love one another. As I have loved you, so you also should love one another. 
35
This is how all will know that you are my
disciples, if you have love for one another." 
36
Simon Peter said to him, "Master, where
are you going?" Jesus answered (him), "Where I am going, you cannot
follow me now, though you will follow later." 
37
Peter said to him, "Master, why can't I
follow you now? I will lay down my life for you." 
38
Jesus answered, "Will you lay down your
life for me? Amen, amen, I say to you, the cock will not crow before you deny
me three times."

[
⇒
 13:1-
⇒
 19:42] The
Book of Glory. There is a major break here; the word "sign" is used
again only in 
⇒
 John 20:30. In this phase of Jesus'
return to the Father, the discourses (John 13-17) precede the traditional
narrative of the passion (John 18-20) to interpret them for the Christian
reader. This is the only extended example of esoteric teaching of disciples in
John.
2
 [1-20] Washing of the disciples'
feet. This episode occurs in John at the place of the narration of the
institution of the Eucharist in the synoptics. It may be a dramatization of
⇒
 Luke 22:27 - "I am your servant." It is
presented as a "model" ("pattern") of the crucifixion. It
symbolizes cleansing from sin by sacrificial death.
3
 [1] Before the feast of Passover:
this would be Thursday evening, before the day of preparation; in the
synoptics, the Last Supper is a Passover meal taking place, in John's
chronology, on Friday evening. To the end: or, "completely." 
4
 [2] Induced: literally, "The
devil put into the heart that Judas should hand him over."
5
 [5] The act of washing another's
feet was one that could not be required of the lowliest Jewish slave. It is an
allusion to the humiliating death of the crucifixion.
6
 [10] Bathed: many have suggested
that this passage is a symbolic reference to baptism. The Greek root involved
is used in baptismal contexts in 
⇒
 1 Cor 6:11;
⇒
 Eph 5:26; 
⇒
 Titus 3:5;
⇒
 Hebrews 10:22.
7
 [16] Messenger: the Greek has
apostolos, the only occurrence of the term in John. It is not used in the
technical sense here.
8
 [23] The one whom Jesus loved: also
mentioned in 
⇒
 John 19:26;
⇒
 20:2; 
⇒
 21:7. A
disciple, called "another disciple" or "the other
disciple," is mentioned in 
⇒
 John 18:15 and
⇒
 John 20:2; in the latter reference he is
identified with the disciple whom Jesus loved. There is also an unnamed
disciple in 
⇒
 John 1:35-40; see the note on
⇒
 John 1:37.
9
 [26] Morsel: probably the bitter
herb dipped in salt water.
10
[
⇒
 13:31-
⇒
 17:26] Two
farewell discourses and a prayer. These seem to be Johannine compositions,
including sayings of Jesus at the Last Supper and on other occasions, modeled
on similar farewell discourses in Greek literature and the Old Testament (of
Moses, Joshua, David).
11
 [31-38] Introduction: departure and
return. Terms of coming and going predominate. These verses form an
introduction to the last discourse of Jesus, which extends through John 14-17.
In it John has collected Jesus' words to his own (
⇒
13:1). There are indications that several speeches have been fused
together, e.g., in 
⇒
 John 14:31 and
⇒
 John 17:1.
12
 [34] I give you a new commandment:
this puts Jesus on a par with Yahweh. The commandment itself is not new; cf
⇒
 Lev 19:18 and the note there.
