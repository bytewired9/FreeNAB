[1]
 We ask you, brothers, with regard to the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our assembling with him, 
2
not to be shaken out of your minds suddenly, or
to be alarmed either by a "spirit," 
[2]
 or by an
oral statement, or by a letter allegedly from us to the effect that the day of
the Lord is at hand. 
3
Let no one deceive you in any way. For unless
the apostasy comes first and the lawless one is revealed, 
[3]
the one doomed to perdition, 
4
who opposes and exalts himself above every
so-called god and object of worship, so as to seat himself in the temple of
God, 
[4]
 claiming that he is a god -  
5
do you not recall that while I was still with
you I told you these things? 
6
And now you know what is restraining, 
[5]
that he may be revealed in his time. 
7
[6]
 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at
work. But the one who restrains is to do so only for the present, until he is
removed from the scene. 
8
And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom
the Lord (Jesus) will kill with the breath of his mouth and render powerless by
the manifestation of his coming, 
9
the one whose coming springs from the power of
Satan in every mighty deed and in signs and wonders that lie, 
10
and in every wicked deceit for those who are
perishing because they have not accepted the love of truth so that they may be
saved. 
11
Therefore, God is sending them a deceiving
power so that they may believe the lie, 
12
that all who have not believed the truth but
have approved wrongdoing may be condemned. 
13
But we ought to give thanks to God for you
always, brothers loved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits 
[7]
for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in truth. 
14
To this end he has (also) called you through
our gospel to possess the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
15
Therefore, brothers, stand firm and hold fast
to the traditions that you were taught, either by an oral statement or by a
letter of ours. 
[8]
16
May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our
Father, who has loved us and given us everlasting encouragement and good hope
through his grace, 
17
encourage your hearts and strengthen them in
every good deed and word.

 [1-17] The Thessalonians have been
shaken by a message purporting to come from Paul himself that the day of the
Lord is already present. He warns against this deception in eschatology by
citing a scenario of events that must first occur (
⇒
 2 Thes
2:3-12) before the end will come. The overall point Paul makes is the
need to reject such lies as Satan sends; he also reaffirms the Thessalonians in
their calling (
⇒
 2 Thes 2:13-14). They are to
uphold what Paul himself has taught (
⇒
 2 Thes
2:15). There is a concluding prayer for their strengthening
(
⇒
 2 Thes 2:16-17). As in 
⇒
 2 Thes
1:8-10, the Old Testament provides a good deal of coloring; cf
especially 
⇒
 Isaiah 14:13-14;
⇒
 66:15, 
⇒
 18-21;
⇒
 Ezekiel 28:2-9; 
⇒
 Daniel
11:36-37. The contents of 
⇒
 2 Thes 2:3b-8
may come from a previously existing apocalypse. The details have been variously
interpreted. An alternative to the possibilities noted below understands that
an oracular utterance, supposedly coming from a prophetic spirit
(
⇒
 2 Thes 2:2-3a), has so disrupted the community's
thinking that its effects may be compared to those of the mania connected with
the worship of the Greek god Dionysus. On this view, the writer seems to allude
in 
⇒
 2 Thes 2:6-8 to Dionysiac "seizure,"
although, of course, ironically, somewhat as Paul alludes to witchcraft
("an evil eye") in 
⇒
 Gal 3:1 in speaking of
the threat to faith posed by those disturbing the Galatians
(
⇒
 Gal 1:6-7; 
⇒
 5:10b). On
this view of 
⇒
 2 Thes 2:2, the Greek participles
katechon (rendered above as what is restraining) and katechon (the one who
restrains) are to be translated "the seizing power" in
⇒
 2 Thes 2:6 and "the seizer" in 
⇒
 2
Thes 2:7. They then allude to a pseudocharismatic force or spirit of
Dionysiac character that has suddenly taken hold of the Thessalonian community
(see 
⇒
 2 Thes 2:2). The addressees know
(
⇒
 2 Thes 2:6) this force or spirit because of the
problem it is causing. This pseudocharismatic force or spirit is a kind of
anticipation and advance proof of the ultimate, climactic figure (the lawless
one or the rebel, 
⇒
 2 Thes 2:3), of which the
community has been warned (see the note on 
⇒
 1 Thes
3:3). It is, however, only the beginning of the end that the latter's
manifestation entails; the end is not yet. For in the course of the mystery of
lawlessness (
⇒
 2 Thes 2:7), false prophetism, after
it ceases in the Thessalonian community, will be manifested in the world at
large (
⇒
 2 Thes 2:8-12), where it will also be
eliminated in turn by the Lord Jesus. 
2
 [2] "Spirit": a
Spirit-inspired utterance or ecstatic revelation. An oral statement: literally,
a "word" or pronouncement, not necessarily of ecstatic origin. A
letter allegedly sent by us: possibly a forged letter, so that Paul calls
attention in 
⇒
 2 Thes 3:17 to his practice of
concluding a genuine letter with a summary note or greeting in his own hand, as
at 
⇒
 Gal 6:11-18 and elsewhere.
3
 [3b-5] This incomplete sentence
(anacoluthon, 
⇒
 2 Thes 2:4) recalls what the
Thessalonians had already been taught, an apocalyptic scenario depicting, in
terms borrowed especially from 
⇒
 Daniel 11:36-37
and related verses, human self-assertiveness against God in the temple of God
itself. The lawless one represents the climax of such activity in this account.
4
 [4] Seat himself in the temple of
God: a reflection of the language in 
⇒
 Daniel 7:23-25;
⇒
 8:9-12; 
⇒
 9:27;
⇒
 11:36-37; 
⇒
 12:11
about the attempt of Antiochus IV Epiphanes to set up a statue of Zeus in the
Jerusalem temple and possibly of the Roman emperor Caligula to do a similar
thing (
⇒
 Mark 13:14). Here the imagery suggests an
attempt to install someone in the place of God, claiming that he is a god (cf
⇒
 Ezekiel 28:2). Usually, it is the Jerusalem temple
that is assumed to be meant; on the alternative view sketched above (see the
note on 
⇒
 2 Thes 2:1-17), the temple refers to the
Christian community.
5
 [6-7] What is restraining . . . the
one who restrains: neuter and masculine, respectively, of a force and person
holding back the lawless one. The Thessalonians know what is meant
(
⇒
 2 Thes 2:6), but the terms, seemingly found only
in this passage and in writings dependent on it, have been variously
interpreted. Traditionally, 
⇒
 2 Thes 2:6 has been
applied to the Roman empire and 
⇒
 2 Thes 2:7 to the
Roman emperor (in Paul's day, Nero) as bulwarks holding back chaos (cf
⇒
 Romans 13:1-7). A second interpretation suggests
that cosmic or angelic powers are binding Satan (
⇒
 2 Thes
2:9) and so restraining him; some relate this to an anti-Christ
figure (
⇒
 1 John 2:18) or to Michael the archangel
(
⇒
 Rev 12:7-9; 
⇒
 20:1-3).
A more recent view suggests that it is the preaching of the Christian gospel
that restrains the end, for in God's plan the end cannot come until the gospel
is preached to all nations (
⇒
 Mark 13:10); in that
case, Paul as missionary preacher par excellence is "the one who
restrains," whose removal (death) will bring the end (
⇒
 2
Thes 2:7). On the alternative view (see the note on
⇒
 2 Thes 2:1-17), the phrases should be referred to
that which and to him who seizes (a prophet) in ecstasy so as to have him speak
pseudo-oracles.
6
 [7-12] The lawless one and the one
who restrains are involved in an activity or process, the mystery of
lawlessness, behind which Satan stands (
⇒
 2 Thes
2:9). The action of the Lord [Jesus] in overcoming the lawless one is
described in Old Testament language (with the breath of his mouth; cf
⇒
 Isaiah 11:4; 
⇒
 Job 4:9;
⇒
 Rev 19:15). His coming is literally the Lord's
"parousia." The biblical concept of the "holy war,"
eschatologically conceived, may underlie the imagery.
7
 [13] As the firstfruits: there is
also strong manuscript evidence for the reading, "God chose you from the
beginning," thus providing a focus on God's activity from beginning to end;
firstfruits is a Pauline term, however; cf 
⇒
 Romans
8:23; 
⇒
 11:16;
⇒
 16:5 among other references.
8
 [15] Reference to an oral statement
and a letter (
⇒
 2 Thes 2:2) and the content here,
including a formula of conclusion (cf 
⇒
 1 Cor
16:13; 
⇒
 Gal 5:1), suggest that
⇒
 2 Thes 2:1-15 or even 
⇒
 2 Thes
2:1-17 are to be taken as a literary unit, notwithstanding the
incidental thanksgiving formula in 
⇒
 2 Thes 2:13.
