[1]
 After this first vision, I, Daniel, had
another, in the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar. 
2
[2]
 In my vision I saw myself in the fortress of
Susa in the province of Elam; I was beside the river Ulai. 
3
I looked up and saw standing by the river a ram
with two great horns, the one larger and newer than the other. 
4
I saw the ram butting toward the west, north,
and south. No beast could withstand it or be rescued from its power; it did
what it pleased and became very powerful. 
5
As I was reflecting, a he-goat with a prominent
horn on its forehead suddenly came from the west across the whole earth without
touching the ground. 
6
It approached the two-horned ram I had seen
standing by the river, and rushed toward it with savage force. 
7
I saw it attack the ram with furious blows when
they met, and break both its horns. It threw the ram, which had not the force
to withstand it, to the ground, and trampled upon it; and no one could rescue
it from its power. 
8
The he-goat became very powerful, but at the height
of its power the great horn was shattered, and in its place came up four
others, facing the four winds of heaven. 
9
[3]
 Out of one of them came a little horn which
kept growing toward the south, the east, and the glorious country. 
10
[4]
 Its power extended to the host of heaven, so
that it cast down to earth some of the host and some of the stars and trampled
on them. 
11
It boasted even against the prince of the host,
from whom it removed the daily sacrifice, and whose sanctuary it cast down, 
12
as well as the host, while sin replaced the
daily sacrifice. It cast truth to the ground, and was succeeding in its
undertaking. 
13
[5]
 I heard a holy one speaking, and another said
to whichever one it was that spoke, "How long shall the events of this
vision last concerning the daily sacrifice, the desolating sin which is placed
there, the sanctuary, and the trampled host?" 
14
He answered him, "For two thousand three
hundred evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary shall be purified." 
15
While I, Daniel, sought the meaning of the
vision I had seen, a manlike figure stood before me, 
16
[6]
 and on the Ulai I heard a human voice that
cried out, "Gabriel, explain the vision to this man." 
17
[7]
 When he came near where I was standing, I fell
prostrate in terror. But he said to me, "Understand, son of man, that the
vision refers to the end time." 
18
As he spoke to me, I fell forward in a faint;
he touched me and made me stand up. 
19
"I will show you," he said,
"what is to happen later in the period of wrath; for at the appointed
time, there will be an end. 
20
"The two-horned ram you saw represents the
kings of the Medes and Persians. 
21
The he-goat is the king of the Greeks, and the
great horn on its forehead is the first king. 
22
The four that rose in its place when it was
broken are four kingdoms that will issue from his nation, but without his
strength. 
23
"After their reign, when sinners have
reached their measure, There shall arise a king, impudent and skilled in
intrigue. 
24
He shall be strong and powerful, bring about
fearful ruin, and succeed in his undertaking. He shall destroy powerful
peoples; 
25
his cunning shall be against the holy ones, his
treacherous conduct shall succeed. He shall be proud of heart and destroy many
by stealth. But when he rises against the prince of princes, he shall be broken
without a hand being raised. 
26
The vision of the evenings and the mornings is
true, as spoken; Do you, however, keep this vision undisclosed, because the
days are to be many." 
27
I, Daniel, was weak and ill for some days; then
I arose and took care of the king's affairs. But I was appalled at the vision,
which I could not understand. 
1
 [1-27] This vision repeats the
major part of the preceding one, though in a more explicit fashion. As
explained in 
⇒
 Daniel 8:20-22 the two-horned ram
represents the combined kingdom of the Medes and Persians, destroyed by
Alexander's Hellenistic empire originating in the west. Once again the author
is interested only in the Seleucid dynasty, which emerged from the dissolution
of Alexander's empire after his death in 323 B.C. 
2
 [2] The fortress of Susa: the royal
palace of the Persian kings in the ancient territory of Elam, east of
Babylonia. The river Ulai: a canal along the northern side of Susa.
3
 [9] A little horn, as in Daniel 7
is Antiochus IV. The glorious country: Palestine.
4
 [10-12] The host of heaven:
ordinarily meaning the stars, here refers to the people of God; cf
⇒
 Daniel 12:3. The prince of the host: God himself,
with whose holy religion Antiochus interfered (
⇒
 1 Macc
1:45).
5
 [13] The desolating sin: the Hebrew
contains a wordplay (shomem) on the name Baal Shamem ("lord of the
heavens," the Greek Zeus Olympios), referring to the statue with which
Antiochus profaned the temple of Jerusalem (
⇒
 2 Macc
6:2).
6
 [16] The angel Gabriel is mentioned
here for the first time in the Bible. There is wordplay in the preceding verse
on geber - manlike figure.
7
 [17] The end time: the day of the
Lord, when God sits in judgment on his enemies (
⇒
8:19).
