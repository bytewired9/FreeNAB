[1]
 In the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia, a
revelation was given to Daniel, who had been named Belteshazzar. The revelation
was certain: a great war; he understood it from the vision. 
2
[2]
 In those days, I, Daniel, mourned three full
weeks. 
3
I ate no savory food, I took no meat or wine,
and I did not anoint myself at all until the end of the three weeks. 
4
[3]
 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month I
was on the bank of the great river, the Tigris. 
5
[4]
 As I looked up, I saw a man dressed in linen
with a belt of fine gold around his waist. 
6
His body was like chrysolite, his face shown
like lightning, his eyes were like fiery torches, his arms and feet looked like
burnished bronze, and his voice sounded like the roar of a multitude. 
7
I alone, Daniel, saw the vision; but great fear
seized the men who were with me; they fled and hid themselves, although they
did not see the vision. 
8
So I was left alone, seeing this great vision.
No strength remained in me; I turned the color of death and was powerless. 
9
When I heard the sound of his voice, I fell
face forward in a faint. 
10
But then a hand touched me, raising me to my
hands and knees. 
11
"Daniel, beloved," he said to me,
"understand the words which I am speaking to you; stand up, for my mission
now is to you." When he said this to me, I stood up trembling. 
12
"Fear not, Daniel," he continued;
"from the first day you made up your mind to acquire understanding and
humble yourself before God, your prayer was heard. Because of it I started out,
13
[5]
 but the prince of the kingdom of Persia stood
in my way for twenty-one days, until finally Michael, one of the chief princes,
came to help me. I left him there with the prince of the kings of Persia, 
14
and came to make you understand what shall
happen to your people in the days to come; for there is yet a vision concerning
those days." 
15
While he was speaking thus to me, I fell
forward and kept silent. 
16
Then something like a man's hand touched my
lips; I opened my mouth and said to the one facing me, "My lord, I was
seized with pangs at the vision and I was powerless. 
17
How can my lord's servant speak with you, my lord?
For now no strength or even breath is left in me." 
18
The one who looked like a man touched me again
and strengthened me, saying, 
19
"Fear not, beloved, you are safe; take
courage and be strong." 
20
When he spoke to me, I grew strong and said,
"Speak, my lord, for you have strengthened me." "Do you
know," he asked, "why I have come to you? Soon I must fight the
prince of Persia again. When I leave, the prince of Greece will come; 
21
but I shall tell you what is written in the
truthful book. No one supports me against all these except Michael, your
prince,

final vision repeats some of the material contained in the others. It is
concerned with history of the worldly kingdoms from the time of Cyrus to the
defeat of the tyrant Antiochus.

occurred during this time (
