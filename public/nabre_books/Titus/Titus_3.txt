 Remind them to be under
the control of magistrates and authorities, to be obedient, to be open to every
good enterprise. 
2
They are to slander no one, to be peaceable,
considerate, exercising all graciousness toward everyone. 
3
For we ourselves were once foolish,
disobedient, deluded, slaves to various desires and pleasures, living in malice
and envy, hateful ourselves and hating one another. 
4
But when the kindness and generous love of God
our savior appeared, 
5
not because of any righteous deeds we had done
but because of his mercy, he saved us through the bath of rebirth and renewal
by the holy Spirit, 
6
whom he richly poured out on us through Jesus
Christ our savior, 
7
so that we might be justified by his grace and
become heirs in hope of eternal life. 
8
This saying is trustworthy. 
[3]
I want you to insist on these points, that those who have believed in God be
careful to devote themselves to good works; these are excellent and beneficial
to others. 
9
[4]
 Avoid foolish arguments, genealogies,
rivalries, and quarrels about the law, for they are useless and futile. 
10
After a first and second warning, break off
contact with a heretic, 
11
realizing that such a person is perverted and
sinful and stands self-condemned.

[5]
 When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, try
to join me at Nicopolis, where I have decided to spend the winter. 
13
Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey
soon, and see to it that they have everything they need. 
14
But let our people, too, learn to devote
themselves to good works to supply urgent needs, so that they may not be
unproductive. 
15
All who are with me send you greetings. Greet
those who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you.

 [1-8] The list of Christian duties
continues from 
⇒
 Titus 2:9-10, undergirded again as
in 
⇒
 Titus 2:11-13 by appeal to what God in Christ
has done (
⇒
 Titus 2:4-7; cf 
⇒
2:11-14). The spiritual renewal of the Cretans, signified in God's
merciful gift of baptism (
⇒
 Titus 3:4-7), should be
reflected in their improved attitude toward civil authority and in their
Christian relationship with all (
⇒
 Titus 3:1-3).

 [1] Magistrates and authorities:
some interpreters understand these terms as referring to the principalities and
powers of the heavenly hierarchy. To be open to every good enterprise: this
implies being good citizens. It could also be translated "ready to do
every sort of good work" (as Christians); cf 
⇒
3:14. 
3
 [8-11] In matters of good conduct
and religious doctrine, Titus is to stand firm.

 [12-15] Artemas or Tychicus (

 2
Tim 4:12) is to replace Titus, who will join Paul in his winter
sojourn at Nicopolis in Epirus, on the western coast of Greece.
