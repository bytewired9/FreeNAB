 Paul, a slave of God and apostle of Jesus
Christ for the sake of the faith of God's chosen ones and the recognition of
religious truth, 
2
in the hope of eternal life that God, who does
not lie, promised before time began, 
3
who indeed at the proper time revealed his word
in the proclamation with which I was entrusted by the command of God our
savior, 
4
to Titus, my true child in our common faith:
grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our savior. 
5
[2]
 For this reason I left you in Crete so that you
might set right what remains to be done and appoint presbyters in every town,
as I directed you, 
6
on condition that a man be blameless, married
only once, with believing children who are not accused of licentiousness or
rebellious. 
7
For a bishop as God's steward must be
blameless, not arrogant, not irritable, not a drunkard, not aggressive, not
greedy for sordid gain, 
8
but hospitable, a lover of goodness, temperate,
just, holy, and self-controlled, 
9
holding fast to the true message as taught so
that he will be able both to exhort with sound doctrine and to refute
opponents. 
10
[3]
 For there are also many rebels, idle talkers
and deceivers, especially the Jewish Christians. 
[4]
11
It is imperative to silence them, as they are
upsetting whole families by teaching for sordid gain what they should not. 
12
One of them, a prophet of their own, once said,
"Cretans have always been liars, vicious beasts, and lazy gluttons." 
[5]
13
That testimony is true. Therefore, admonish
them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith, 
14
instead of paying attention to Jewish myths and
regulations of people who have repudiated the truth. 
15
To the clean all things are clean, but to those
who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is clean; in fact, both their minds and
their consciences are tainted. 
16
They claim to know God, but by their deeds they
deny him. They are vile and disobedient and unqualified for any good deed.

 [1-4] On the epistolary form, see
the note on 
⇒
 Romans 1:1-7. The apostolate is the
divinely appointed mission to lead others to the true faith and through it to
eternal salvation (1-3). 
2
 [5-9] This instruction on the
selection and appointment of presbyters, substantially identical with that in
⇒
 1 Tim 3:1-7 on a bishop (see the note there), was
aimed at strengthening the authority of Titus by apostolic mandate; cf
⇒
 Titus 2:15. In 
⇒
1:5, 7 and 
⇒
 Acts
20:17, 
⇒
 28, the terms episkopos and
presbyteros ("bishop" and "presbyter") refer to the same
persons. Deacons are not mentioned in Titus. See also the note on 
⇒
 Philippians
1:1.
3
 [10-16] This adverse criticism of
the defects within the community is directed especially against certain Jewish
Christians, who busy themselves with useless speculations over persons
mentioned in the Old Testament, insist on the observance of Jewish ritual
purity regulations, and thus upset whole families by teaching things they have
no right to teach; cf 
⇒
 Titus 3:9;
⇒
 1 Tim 1:3-10.
