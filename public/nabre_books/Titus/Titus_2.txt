 As for yourself, you must say what is consistent
with sound doctrine, namely, 
2
that older men should be temperate, dignified,
self-controlled, sound in faith, love, and endurance. 
3
Similarly, older women should be reverent in
their behavior, not slanderers, not addicted to drink, teaching what is good, 
4
so that they may train younger women to love
their husbands and children, 
5
to be self-controlled, chaste, good homemakers,
under the control of their husbands, so that the word of God may not be
discredited. 
6
Urge the younger men, similarly, to control
themselves, 
7
showing yourself as a model of good deeds in
every respect, with integrity in your teaching, dignity, 
8
and sound speech that cannot be criticized, so
that the opponent will be put to shame without anything bad to say about us. 
9
Slaves are to be under the control of their
masters in all respects, giving them satisfaction, not talking back to them 
10
or stealing from them, but exhibiting complete
good faith, so as to adorn the doctrine of God our savior in every way. 
11
[2]
 For the grace of God has appeared, saving all 
12
and training us to reject godless ways and
worldly desires and to live temperately, justly, and devoutly in this age, 
13
as we await the blessed hope, the appearance 
[3]
of the glory of the great God and of our savior Jesus Christ, 
14
who gave himself for us to deliver us from all
lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people as his own, eager to do what is
good. 
15
Say these things. Exhort and correct with all authority.
Let no one look down on you.

 [1-10] One of Titus' main tasks in
Crete is to become acquainted with the character of the Cretans and thereby
learn to cope with its deficiencies (see 
⇒
1:12). The counsel is not only for Titus himself but for various
classes of people with whom he must deal: older men and women
(
⇒
 Titus 2:2-4), younger women and men
(
⇒
 Titus 2:4-7), and slaves (
⇒
2:9-10); cf 
⇒
 Eph 6:1-9;
⇒
 Col 3:18-
⇒
 4:1.

 [11-15] Underlying the admonitions
for moral improvement in 
⇒
 Titus 2:1-10 as the moving
force is the constant appeal to God's revelation of salvation in Christ, with
its demand for transformation of life.

 [13] The blessed hope, the
appearance: literally, "the blessed hope and appearance," but the use
of a single article in Greek strongly suggests an epexegetical, i.e.,
explanatory sense. Of the great God and of our savior Jesus Christ: another possible
translation is "of our great God and savior Jesus Christ."
