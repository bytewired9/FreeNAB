1
All the tribes of Israel came to David in
Hebron and said: "Here we are, your bone and your flesh. 
2
In days past, when Saul was our king, it was
you who led the Israelites out and brought them back. And the LORD said to you,
'You shall shepherd my people Israel and shall be commander of Israel.'" 
3
When all the elders of Israel came to David in
Hebron, King David made an agreement with them there before the LORD, and they
anointed him king of Israel. 
4
David was thirty years old when he became king,
and he reigned for forty years: 
5
seven years and six months in Hebron over
Judah, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem over all Israel and Judah. 
6
[1]
 Then the king and his men set out for
Jerusalem against the Jebusites who inhabited the region. David was told,
"You cannot enter here: the blind and the lame will drive you away!"
which was their way of saying, "David cannot enter here." 
7
But David did take the stronghold of Zion,
which is the City of David. 
8
On that day David said: "All who wish to
attack the Jebusites must strike at them through the water shaft. The lame and
the blind shall be the personal enemies of David." That is why it is said,
"The blind and the lame shall not enter the palace." 
9
David then dwelt in the stronghold, which was
called the City of David; he built up the area from Millo to the palace. 
10
David grew steadily more powerful, for the LORD
of hosts was with him. 
11
Hiram, king of Tyre, sent ambassadors to David;
he furnished cedar wood, as well as carpenters and masons, who built a palace
for David. 
12
And David knew that the LORD had established
him as king of Israel and had exalted his rule for the sake of his people
Israel. 
13
David took more concubines and wives in
Jerusalem after he had come from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born
to him in Jerusalem. 
14
These are the names of those who were born to
him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
15
Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
16
Elishama, Baaliada, and Eliphelet. 
17
[2]
 When the Philistines heard that David had been
anointed king of Israel, they all took the field in search of him. On hearing
this, David went down to the refuge. 
18
[3]
 The Philistines came and overran the valley of
Rephaim. 
19
David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I
attack the Philistines - will you deliver them into my grip?" The LORD
replied to David, "Attack, for I will surely deliver the Philistines into
your grip." 
20
[4]
 David then went to Baal-perazim, where he
defeated them. He said, "The LORD has scattered my enemies before me like
waters that have broken free." That is why the place is called
Baal-perazim. 
21
They abandoned their gods there, and David and
his men carried them away. 
22
But the Philistines came up again and overran
the valley of Rephaim. 
23
So David inquired of the LORD, who replied:
"You must not attack frontally, but circle their rear and meet them before
the mastic trees. 
24
[5]
 When you hear a sound of marching in the tops
of the mastic trees, act decisively, for the LORD will have gone forth before
you to attack the camp of the Philistines." 
25
David obeyed the LORD'S command and routed the
Philistines from Gibeon as far as Gezer. 
1
 [6-12] David's most important
military exploit, the taking of Jerusalem, is here presented before his battles
with the Philistines, 
⇒
 2 Sam 5:17-25, which were
earlier in time. The sense of 
⇒
 2 Sam 5:6,
8 is in doubt. 
2
 [17] Refuge: probably near Adullam
(
⇒
 1 Sam 22:1-5).
3
 [18-25] The successive defeats of
the Philistines in the valley of Rephaim southwest of Jerusalem had the effect
of blocking their access to the mountain ridge near Gibeon, and confining them
to their holdings on the coast and in the foothills beyond Gezer to the west
and south.
4
 [20] Baal-perazim: means
approximately "the lord of scatterings."
5
 [24] Sound of marching: the wind in
the treetops suggestive of the Lord's footsteps.
