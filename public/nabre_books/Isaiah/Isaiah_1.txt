1
[1]
 The vision which Isaiah, son of Amoz, had concerning
Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of
Judah. 
2
Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth, for the
LORD speaks: Sons have I raised and reared, but they have disowned me! 
3
[2]
 An ox knows its owner, and an ass, its
master's manger; But Israel does not know, my people has not understood. 
4
[3]
 Ah! sinful nation, people laden with
wickedness, evil race, corrupt children! They have forsaken the LORD, spurned
the Holy One of Israel, apostatized. 
5
[4]
 Where would you yet be struck, you that rebel
again and again? The whole head is sick, the whole heart faint. 
6
From the sole of the foot to the head there is
no sound spot: Wound and welt and gaping gash, not drained, or bandaged, or
eased with salve. 
7
Your country is waste, your cities burnt with
fire; Your land before your eyes strangers devour (a waste, like Sodom
overthrown) -  
8
[5]
 And daughter Zion is left like a hut in a
vineyard, Like a shed in a melon patch, like a city blockaded. 
9
[6]
 Unless the LORD of hosts had left us a scanty
remnant, We had become as Sodom, we should be like Gomorrah. 
10
Hear the word of the LORD, princes of Sodom!
Listen to the instruction of our God, people of Gomorrah! 
11
[7]
 What care I for the number of your sacrifices?
says the LORD. I have had enough of whole-burnt rams and fat of fatlings; In
the blood of calves, lambs and goats I find no pleasure. 
12
When you come in to visit me, who asks these
things of you? 
13
[8]
 Trample my courts no more! Bring no more worthless
offerings; your incense is loathsome to me. New moon and sabbath, calling of
assemblies, octaves with wickedness: these I cannot bear. 
14
Your new moons and festivals I detest; they
weigh me down, I tire of the load. 
15
[9]
 When you spread out your hands, I close my
eyes to you; Though you pray the more, I will not listen. Your hands are full
of blood! 
16
Wash yourselves clean! Put away your misdeeds
from before my eyes; cease doing evil; 
17
learn to do good. Make justice your aim:
redress the wronged, hear the orphan's plea, defend the widow. 
18
Come now, let us set things right, says the
LORD: Though your sins be like scarlet, they may become white as snow; Though
they be crimson red, they may become white as wool. 
19
If you are willing, and obey, you shall eat the
good things of the land; 
20
But if you refuse and resist, the sword shall
consume you: for the mouth of the LORD has spoken! 
21
[10]
 How has she turned adulteress, the faithful
city, so upright! Justice used to lodge within her, but now, murderers. 
22
Your silver is turned to dross, your wine is
mixed with water. 
23
Your princes are rebels and comrades of
thieves; Each one of them loves a bribe and looks for gifts. The fatherless
they defend not, and the widow's plea does not reach them. 
24
Now, therefore, says the Lord, the LORD of
hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ah! I will take vengeance on my foes and fully
repay my enemies! 
25
I will turn my hand against you, and refine
your dross in the furnace, removing all your alloy. 
26
I will restore your judges as at first, and
your counselors as in the beginning; After that you shall be called city of
justice, faithful city. 
27
[11]
 Zion shall be redeemed by judgment, and her
repentant ones by justice. 
28
Rebels and sinners alike shall be crushed,
those who desert the LORD shall be consumed. 
29
[12]
 You shall be ashamed of the terebinths which
you prized, and blush for the groves which you chose. 
30
You shall become like a tree with falling
leaves, like a garden that has no water. 
31
The strong man shall turn to tow, and his work
shall become a spark; Both shall burn together, and there shall be none to
quench the flames. 
1
 [1] The title of the book: an
editorial addition. Isaiah: meaning "the salvation of the LORD," or
"The LORD is salvation." Amoz: not the minor prophet. Judah: the southern
kingdom of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. Uzziah: also called Azariah; cf
⇒
 2 Kings 15:1; 
⇒
 2 Chron
26:1. 
2
 [3] Israel: not the northern
kingdom, as in 
⇒
 Isaiah 9:11 exclusively, which
Isaiah usually calls "Ephraim" from the tribe bordering on the
southern kingdom, but the entire chosen people, cf 
⇒
8:14.
3
 [4] Holy One of Israel: a title
used frequently by Isaiah, rarely by other writers.
4
 [5-8] Sufferings inflicted upon
God's people for their sins.
5
 [8] Daughter Zion: Jerusalem. Hut .
. . shed: for the shelter of watchmen and laborers.
6
 [9] LORD of hosts: God, who is the
Creator and Ruler of the heavenly armies of the angels, stars, etc. Remnant:
St. Paul uses this text in 
⇒
 Romans 9:29 where he
speaks of God's saving mercy toward the Jews and Gentiles. Sodom . . .
Gomorrah: cf Genesis 19.
7
 [11] The number of your sacrifices:
however numerous, they are not acceptable without the right dispositions on the
part of the worshipers.
8
 [13] Octaves with wickedness: the
solemnity of the feasts marred by evil deeds.
9
 [15] Spread out your hands: in
prayer.
10
 [21] A picture of Jerusalem, once
so faithful to God. Apostasy from the covenant is often likened by the prophets
to unfaithfulness to the marriage vow.
11
 [27] This verse is the key to the
whole Book of Isaiah. Zion's defiant persistence in sin has demanded a divine
judgment, by which her survivors will be cleansed and will return to God in
justice; cf 
⇒
 Isaiah 40:2.
12
 [29] Terebinths which you prized .
. . groves which you chose: as popular shrines for idolatrous worship.
