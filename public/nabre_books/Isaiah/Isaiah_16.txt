Send them forth, hugging the earth like
reptiles, from Sela across the desert, to the mount of daughter Zion. 
2
[1]
 Like flushed birds, like startled nestlings,
Are the daughters of Moab at the fords of the Arnon. 
3
[2]
 Offer counsel, take their part: at high noon let
your shadow be like the night, To hide the outcasts, to conceal the fugitives. 
4
Let the outcasts of Moab live with you, be
their shelter from the destroyer. When the struggle is ended, the ruin
complete, and they have done with trampling the land, 
5
A throne shall be set up in mercy, and on it
shall sit in fidelity (in David's tent) A judge upholding right and prompt to
do justice. 
6
We have heard of the pride of Moab, how very
proud he is, With his haughty, arrogant insolence that his empty words do not
match. 
7
[3]
[4]
 Therefore Moab wails for
Moab, everywhere they wail; For the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth they sigh,
stricken with grief. 
8
[5]
 The terraced slopes of Heshbon languish, the
vines of Sibmah, Whose clusters overpowered the lords of nations, While they
reached as far as Jazer and scattered over the desert, And whose branches
spread forth and extended over the sea. 
9
Therefore I weep with Jazer for the vines of
Sibmah; I water you with tears, Heshbon and Elealeh; For on your summer fruits
and harvests the battle cry has fallen. 
10
From the orchards are taken away joy and
gladness, In the vineyards there is no singing, no shout of joy; In the wine
presses no one treads grapes, the vintage shout is stilled. 
11
Therefore for Moab my breast moans like a lyre,
and my heart for Kir-hareseth. 
12
[6]
 When Moab grows weary on the high places, he
shall enter his sanctuary to pray, but it shall avail him nothing. 
13
[7]
 This is the word the LORD spoke against Moab
in times past. 
14
But now the LORD has spoken: In three years, like
those of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be degraded despite all its great
multitude; there shall be a remnant, very small and weak. 
1
 [2] The Arnon: principal river of
Moab. 
2
 [3-5] Directed to Jerusalem, which
should receive the suffering Moabites with mercy, as befits the city of David's
family, who were partly descended from Ruth the Moabite.
3
 [7-14] Moab had been prosperous;
now it has become a desert.

 [7] Raisin cakes: masses of dried
compressed grapes used as food (cf 
⇒
 2 Sam 6:19;
⇒
 1 Chron 16:3; 
⇒
 Song
2:5), and also in pagan cult (
⇒
 Hosea 3:1).
5
 [8] Desert: to the east. Sea: the
Dead Sea.
6
 [12] In vain do the Moabites appeal
to their god Chemosh.
7
 [13-14] A prose application of the
preceding poetic oracle against Moab (
⇒
15:1-
⇒
 16:12); cf
⇒
 Jeremiah 4:8. Like those of a hireling: who
fulfills his period of service according to the shortest manner of reckoning;
cf 
⇒
 Isaiah 21:16.
