 Oracle on Tyre: Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for
your port is destroyed; From the land of the Kittim 
[2]
 the
news reaches them. 
2
Silence! you who dwell on the coast, you
merchants of Sidon, Whose messengers crossed the sea 
3
[3]
 over the deep waters. The grain of Shihor, the
harvest of the Nile, was her revenue, and she the merchant among nations. 
4
[4]
 Shame, O Sidon, fortress on the sea, for the
sea has spoken: "I have not been in labor, nor given birth, nor raised
young men, nor reared virgins." 
5
When it is heard in Egypt they shall be in
anguish at the news of Tyre. 
6
Pass over to Tarshish, wailing, you who dwell
on the coast! 
7
Is this your wanton city, whose origin is from
old, Whose feet have taken her to dwell in distant lands? 
8
Who has planned such a thing against Tyre, the
bestower of crowns, Whose merchants are princes, whose traders are the earth's
honored men? 
9
The LORD of hosts has planned it, to disgrace
all pride of majesty, to degrade all the earth's honored men. 
10
Cross to your own land, O ship of Tarshish; the
harbor is no more. 
11
[5]
 His hand he stretches out over the sea, he
shakes kingdoms; The LORD has ordered the destruction of Canaan's strongholds. 
12
You shall exult no more, he says, you who are
now oppressed, virgin daughter Sidon. Arise, pass over to the Kittim, even
there you shall find no rest. 
13
[6]
 (This people is the land of the Chaldeans, not
Assyria.) She whom the impious founded, setting up towers for her, Has had her
castles destroyed, and has been turned into a ruin. 
14
Lament, O ships of Tarshish, for your haven is
destroyed. 
15
[7]
 On that day, Tyre shall be forgotten for
seventy years. With the days of another king, at the end of seventy years, it
shall be for Tyre as in the song about the harlot: 
16
Take a harp, go about the city, O forgotten
harlot; Pluck the strings skillfully, sing many songs, that they may remember
you. 
17
At the end of the seventy years the LORD shall
visit Tyre. She shall return to her hire and deal with all the world's kingdoms
on the face of the earth. 
18
[8]
 But her merchandise and her hire shall be
sacred to the LORD. It shall not be stored up or laid away, but from her
merchandise those who dwell before the LORD shall eat their fill and clothe
themselves in choice attire.
