[2]
 Hear me, O coastlands,
listen, O distant peoples. The LORD called me from birth, from my mother's womb
he gave me my name. 
2
[3]
 He made of me a sharp-edged sword and
concealed me in the shadow of his arm. He made me a polished arrow, in his
quiver he hid me. 
3
[4]
 You are my servant, he said to me, Israel,
through whom I show my glory. 
4
Though I thought I had toiled in vain, and for
nothing, uselessly, spent my strength, Yet my reward is with the LORD, my
recompense is with my God. 
5
For now the LORD has spoken who formed me as
his servant from the womb, That Jacob may be brought back to him and Israel
gathered to him; And I am made glorious in the sight of the LORD, and my God is
now my strength! 
6
[5]
 It is too little, he says, for you to be my
servant, to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and restore the survivors of Israel;
I will make you a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the ends
of the earth. 
7
Thus says the LORD, the redeemer and the Holy
One of Israel, To the one despised, whom the nations abhor, the slave of
rulers: When kings see you, they shall stand up, and princes shall prostrate
themselves Because of the LORD who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel who has
chosen you. 
8
Thus says the LORD: In a time of favor I answer
you, on the day of salvation I help you, To restore the land and allot the
desolate heritages, 
9
Saying to the prisoners: Come out! To those in
darkness: Show yourselves! Along the ways they shall find pasture, on every
bare height shall their pastures be. 
10
They shall not hunger or thirst, nor shall the
scorching wind or the sun strike them; For he who pities them leads them and
guides them beside springs of water. 
11
I will cut a road through all my mountains, and
make my highways level. 
12
[6]
 See, some shall come from afar, others from
the north and the west, and some from the land of Syene. 
13
Sing out, O heavens, and rejoice, O earth,
break forth into song, you mountains. For the LORD comforts his people and
shows mercy to his afflicted. 
14
But Zion said, "The LORD has forsaken me;
my Lord has forgotten me." 
15
Can a mother forget her infant, be without
tenderness for the child of her womb? Even should she forget, I will never
forget you. 
16
[7]
 See, upon the palms of my hands I have written
your name; your walls are ever before me. 
17
Your rebuilders make haste, as those who tore
you down and laid you waste go forth from you; 
18
Look about and see, they are all gathering and
coming to you. As I live, says the LORD, you shall be arrayed with them all as
with adornments, like a bride you shall fasten them on you. 
19
Though you were waste and desolate, a land of
ruins, Now you shall be too small for your inhabitants, while those who
swallowed you up will be far away. 
20
The children whom you had lost shall yet say to
you, "This place is too small for me, make room for me to live in." 
21
You shall ask yourself: "Who has borne me
these? I was bereft and barren (exiled and repudiated); who has reared them? I
was left all alone; where then do these come from?" 
22
Thus says the Lord GOD: See, I will lift up my
hand to the nations, and raise my signal to the peoples; They shall bring your
sons in their arms, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders. 
23
Kings shall be your foster fathers, their
princesses your nurses; Bowing to the ground, they shall worship you and lick
the dust at your feet. Then you shall know that I am the LORD, and those who
hope in me shall never be disappointed. 
24
Thus says the LORD: Can booty be taken from a
warrior? or captives be rescued from a tyrant? 
25
Yes, captives can be taken from a warrior, and
booty be rescued from a tyrant; Those who oppose you I will oppose, and your
sons I will save. 
26
I will make your oppressors eat their own
flesh, and they shall be drunk with their own blood as with the juice of the
grape. All mankind shall know that I, the LORD, am your savior, your redeemer,
the Mighty One of Jacob.

 [1] Gave me my name: designated me
for a special office (cf

 Jeremiah 1:5), or perhaps,

 [2] The Servant was made ready and
fit for the preaching of God's word.
4
 [3] Israel: the Servant is
identified with the people of Israel as their ideal representative; however,
since 
⇒
 Isaiah 49:5, 6
seem to distinguish the Servant from Israel, some regard the word Israel here
as a gloss.
5
 [6] The Servant's vocation will be
not only the restoration of Israel but the conversion of the world; cf
⇒
 Luke 2:32.
