[1]
 Thus says the LORD: Where is the bill of
divorce with which I dismissed your mother? Or to which of my creditors have I
sold you? It was for your sins that you were sold, for your crimes that your
mother was dismissed. 
2
[2]
 Why was no one there when I came? Why did no
one answer when I called? Is my hand too short to ransom? Have I not the strength
to deliver? Lo, with my rebuke I dry up the sea, I turn rivers into a desert;
Their fish rot for lack of water, and die of thirst. 
3
I clothe the heavens in mourning, and make
sackcloth their vesture. 
4
[3]
 The Lord GOD has given me a well-trained
tongue, That I might know how to speak to the weary a word that will rouse
them. Morning after morning he opens my ear that I may hear; 
5
[4]
 And I have not rebelled, have not turned back.
6
[5]
 I gave my back to those who beat me, my cheeks
to those who plucked my beard; My face I did not shield from buffets and
spitting. 
7
The Lord GOD is my help, therefore I am not
disgraced; I have set my face like flint, knowing that I shall not be put to
shame. 
8
He is near who upholds my right; if anyone
wishes to oppose me, let us appear together. Who disputes my right? Let him
confront me. 
9
See, the Lord GOD is my help; who will prove me
wrong? Lo, they will all wear out like cloth, the moth will eat them up. 
10
[6]
 Who among you fears the LORD, heeds his
servant's voice, And walks in darkness without any light, Trusting in the name
of the LORD and relying on his God? 
11
All of you kindle flames and carry about you
fiery darts; Walk by the light of your own fire and by the flares you have
burnt! This is your fate from my hand: you shall lie down in a place of pain.

 [1] Responding to the people's
complaint of utter abandonment by God, the prophet shows that their sins were
responsible for their banishment. Since there was no bill of divorce, the bond
between the Lord and his people still exists and he will ultimately save them. 
2
 [2] Israel's faith in God is weak;
she does not answer his call, nor believe in his promises of deliverance.
3
 [4-11] The third of the four
"Servant-of-the-Lord" oracles; in 
⇒
50:4-9 the Servant speaks; in 
⇒
50:10-11 God reproves the people for not following the Servant.
4
 [5] The Servant does not refuse the
divine vocation.
5
 [6] He willingly submits to insults
and beatings. Plucked my beard: a grave insult.
6
 [10-11] Instead of trusting in the
Lord and his Servant, the people rely on their own devices, to their own
destruction.
