 Thus says the LORD: Observe what is right, do
what is just; for my salvation is about to come, my justice, about to be
revealed. 
2
Happy is the man who does this, the son of man
who holds to it; Who keeps the sabbath free from profanation, and his hand from
any evildoing. 
3
[2]
 Let not the foreigner say, when he would join
himself to the LORD, "The LORD will surely exclude me from his
people"; Nor let the eunuch say, "See, I am a dry tree." 
4
For thus says the LORD: To the eunuchs who
observe my sabbaths and choose what pleases me and hold fast to my covenant, 
5
[3]
 I will give, in my house and within my walls,
a monument and a name Better than sons and daughters; an eternal, imperishable
name will I give them. 
6
And the foreigners who join themselves to the
LORD, ministering to him, Loving the name of the LORD, and becoming his
servants -  All who keep the sabbath
free from profanation and hold to my covenant, 
7
Them I will bring to my holy mountain and make
joyful in my house of prayer; Their holocausts and sacrifices will be
acceptable on my altar, For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all
peoples. 
8
Thus says the Lord GOD, who gathers the
dispersed of Israel: Others will I gather to him besides those already
gathered.

[5]
 All you wild beasts of
the field, come and eat, all you beasts in the forest! 
10
My watchmen are blind, all of them unaware;
They are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; Dreaming as they lie there, loving
their sleep. 
11
They are relentless dogs, they know not when
they have enough. These are the shepherds who know no discretion; Each of them
goes his own way, every one of them to his own gain: 
12
"Come, I will fetch some wine; let us
carouse with strong drink, And tomorrow will be like today, or even
greater."

 [1-8] Participation in the future
messianic salvation is offered to all who believe in the Lord and keep his
commandments, regardless of origin or social condition.

excluded from the community of the Lord; cf

 Wisdom 3:14. Dry tree: unable to
produce the fruit of offspring.

condemned the pagan rites of Baal worship.
