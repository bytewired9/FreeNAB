1
[1]
 Oracle on the wastelands by the sea: Like
whirlwinds sweeping in waves through the Negeb, there comes from the desert,
from the fearful land, 
2
[2]
 A cruel sight, revealed to me: the traitor
betrays, the despoiler spoils. "Go up, Elam; besiege, O Media; I will put
an end to all groaning!" 
3
Therefore my loins are filled with anguish,
pangs have seized me like those of a woman in labor; I am too bewildered to
hear, too dismayed to look. 
4
My mind reels, shuddering assails me; My
yearning for twilight has turned into dread. 
5
[3]
 They set the table, spread out the rugs; they
eat, they drink. Rise up, O princes, oil the shield! 
6
For thus says my Lord to me: Go, station a
watchman, let him tell what he sees. 
7
If he sees a chariot, a pair of horses, Someone
riding an ass, someone riding a camel, Then let him pay heed, very close heed. 
8
Then the watchman cried, "On the
watchtower, O my Lord, I stand constantly by day; And I stay at my post through
all the watches of the night. 
9
Here he comes now: a single chariot, a pair of
horses; He calls out and says, 'Fallen, fallen is Babylon, And all the images
of her gods are smashed to the ground.'" 
10
O my people who have been threshed, beaten on my
threshing floor! What I have heard from the LORD of hosts, The God of Israel, I
have announced to you. 
11
[4]
 Oracle on Edom: They call to me from Seir,
"Watchman, how much longer the night? Watchman, how much longer the
night?" 
12
The watchman replies, "Morning has come,
and again night. If you will ask, ask; come back again." 
13
[5]
 Oracle on Arabia: In the thicket in the nomad
country spend the night, O caravans of Dedanites. 
14
Meet the thirsty, bring them water; you who
dwell in the land of Tema, greet the fugitives with bread. 
15
They flee from the sword, from the whetted
sword; From the taut bow, from the fury of battle. 
16
[6]
 For thus says the Lord to me: In another year,
like those of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall come to an end. 
17
Few of Kedar's stalwart archers shall remain,
for the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken. 
1
 [1] Wastelands by the sea:
Babylonia. Negeb: the desert south of Judah. 
2
 [2] Elam . . . Media: nations which, under the leadership of
Cyrus, captured Babylon in 538 B.C. End to all groaning: those who were captive
of Babylon shall be freed.
3
 [5] Babylon is destroyed while its
leaders are feasting; cf Daniel 5. Oil the shield: shields were oiled and greased
so as to divert blows more easily.
4
 [11-12] Seir: another name for
Edom. The Edomites ask the prophet how much longer they must suffer (the night
of suffering); he answers ambiguously: "Liberation (morning) and further
suffering (night)," but perhaps they will later receive a more encouraging
answer (ask, come back again).
5
 [13-14] Arabia: that is, the nomad
country. Dedanites: an Arab tribe associated with Edom and Tema, and living east
of the Red Sea; cf

 Genesis 10:7;
⇒
 25:3; 
⇒
 Jeremiah
25:23.
6
 [16] Year . . . of a hireling: see
note on 
⇒
 16:14. Kedar: a nomad tribe in Arabia; cf
⇒
 Isaiah 42:11; 
⇒
 60:7;

 Psalm 120:5.
