[1]
 This is what Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw
concerning Judah and Jerusalem. 
2
[2]
 In days to come, The mountain of the LORD'S
house shall be established as the highest mountain and raised above the hills.
All nations shall stream toward it; 
3
[3]
 many peoples shall come and say: "Come,
let us climb the LORD'S mountain, to the house of the God of Jacob, That he may
instruct us in his ways, and we may walk in his paths." For from Zion
shall go forth instruction, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. 
4
He shall judge between the nations, and impose
terms on many peoples. They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their
spears into pruning hooks; One nation shall not raise the sword against
another, nor shall they train for war again. 
5
O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the
light of the LORD! 
6
[4]
 You have abandoned your people, the house of
Jacob, Because they are filled with fortunetellers and soothsayers, like the
Philistines; they covenant with strangers. 
7
Their land is full of silver and gold, and
there is no end to their treasures; Their land is full of horses, and there is
no end to their chariots. 
8
Their land is full of idols; they worship the
works of their hands, that which their fingers have made. 
9
But man is abased, each one brought low. (Do
not pardon them!) 
10
Get behind the rocks, hide in the dust, From
the terror of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty! 
11
[5]
 The haughty eyes of man will be lowered, the
arrogance of men will be abased, and the LORD alone will be exalted, on that
day. 
12
For the LORD of hosts will have his day against
all that is proud and arrogant, all that is high, and it will be brought low; 
13
[6]
 Yes, against all the cedars of Lebanon and all
the oaks of Bashan, 
14
Against all the lofty mountains and all the
high hills, 
15
Against every lofty tower and every fortified
wall, 
16
[7]
 Against all the ships of Tarshish and all
stately vessels. 
17
Human pride will be abased, the arrogance of
men brought low, And the LORD alone will be exalted, on that day. 
18
The idols will perish forever. 
19
Men will go into caves in the rocks and into holes
in the earth, From the terror of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when
he arises to overawe the earth. 
20
On that day men will throw to the moles and the
bats the idols of silver and gold which they made for worship. 
21
They go into caverns in the rocks and into
crevices in the cliffs, From the terror of the LORD and the splendor of his
majesty, when he arises to overawe the earth. 
22
As for you, let man alone, in whose nostrils is
but a breath; for what is he worth?

 [1] An editorial addition
introducing Isaiah 2-5. 
2
 [2-4] The messianic destiny which
ensures Judah's later restoration. In the messianic kingdom the prophets
generally see the Lord's house as the seat of authority and the source of clear
and certain doctrine; also, its rule willingly accepted by all peoples,
maintained by spiritual sanctions, and tending to universal peace. This passage
is found substantially unchanged in 
⇒
 Micah 4:1-3; it
probably, although not certainly, has Isaiah as its author.
3
 [3] Zion . . . Jerusalem: types of the earthly center of the
messianic kingdom.
4
 [6] Fortune-tellers and
soothsayers: divination was strictly forbidden; cf

 Deut
18:9-14.
5
 [11] That day: the day of the Lord,
a day of retribution, often referred to, especially by the minor prophets, and
described in terms of natural phenomena: earthquake, fire, storm.

Syria, famed for its cedars. Bashan: the wooded uplands east of the Jordan
River.
