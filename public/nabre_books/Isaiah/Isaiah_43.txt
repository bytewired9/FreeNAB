1
But now, thus says the LORD, who created you, O
Jacob, and formed you, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have
called you by name: you are mine. 
2
When you pass through the water, I will be with
you; in the rivers you shall not drown. When you walk through fire, you shall not
be burned; the flames shall not consume you. 
3
[1]
 For I am the LORD, your God, the Holy One of
Israel, your savior. I give Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in return
for you. 
4
Because you are precious in my eyes and
glorious, and because I love you, I give men in return for you and peoples in
exchange for your life. 
5
Fear not, for I am with you; from the east I
will bring back your descendants, from the west I will gather you. 
6
I will say to the north: Give them up! and to
the south: Hold not back! Bring back my sons from afar, and my daughters from
the ends of the earth: 
7
Everyone who is named as mine, whom I created
for my glory, whom I formed and made. 
8
Lead out the people who are blind though they
have eyes, who are deaf though they have ears. 
9
[2]
 Let all the nations gather together, let the
peoples assemble! Who among them could have revealed this, or foretold to us
the earlier things? Let them produce witnesses to prove themselves right, that
one may hear and say, "It is true!" 
10
You are my witnesses, says the LORD, my
servants whom I have chosen To know and believe in me and understand that it is
I. Before me no god was formed, and after me there shall be none. 
11
It is I, I the LORD; there is no savior but me.
12
It is I who foretold, I who saved; I made it
known, not any strange god among you; You are my witnesses, says the LORD. I am
God, 
13
yes, from eternity I am He; There is none who
can deliver from my hand: who can countermand what I do? 
14
[3]
 Thus says the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One
of Israel: For your sakes I send to Babylon; I will lower all the bars, and the
Chaldeans shall cry out in lamentation. 
15
I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of
Israel, your King. 
16
Thus says the LORD, who opens a way in the sea
and a path in the mighty waters, 
17
Who leads out chariots and horsemen, a powerful
army, Till they lie prostrate together, never to rise, snuffed out and quenched
like a wick. 
18
[4]
 Remember not the events of the past, the
things of long ago consider not; 
19
See, I am doing something new! Now it springs
forth, do you not perceive it? In the desert I make a way, in the wasteland,
rivers. 
20
Wild beasts honor me, jackals and ostriches,
For I put water in the desert and rivers in the wasteland for my chosen people
to drink, 
21
The people whom I formed for myself, that they
might announce my praise. 
22
[5]
 Yet you did not call upon me, O Jacob, for you
grew weary of me, O Israel. 
23
You did not bring me sheep for your holocausts,
nor honor me with your sacrifices. I did not exact from you the service of
offerings, nor weary you for frankincense. 
24
[6]
 You did not buy me sweet cane for money, nor
fill me with the fat of your sacrifices; Instead, you burdened me with your
sins, and wearied me with your crimes. 
25
It is I, I, who wipe out, for my own sake, your
offenses; your sins I remember no more. 
26
Would you have me remember, have us come to
trial? Speak up, prove your innocence! 
27
[7]
 Your first father sinned; your spokesmen
rebelled against me 
28
Till I repudiated the holy gates, put Jacob
under the ban, and exposed Israel to scorn. 
1
 [3-4] Egypt . . . Ethiopia and
Seba: countries which God permitted the Persians to conquer in return for
having given Israel its freedom. 
2
 [9] Only God can know and predict
future events; cf 
⇒
 Isaiah 41:1-5,
⇒
 21-29.
3
 [14-17] The destruction of Babylon.
4
 [18] No need to think solely of the
past wonders of the exodus from Egypt; equally great is the exodus from
Babylon.
5
 [22-28] The reason for the
liberation of the Israelites is not their fidelity but rather God's mercy.
6
 [24] Sweet cane: a fragrant
substance used in making incense and the sacred anointing oil; cf
⇒
 Exodus 30:23; 
⇒
 Jeremiah
6:20.

or collectively "early ancestors." Spokesmen: leaders, priests,
