 Seven women will take hold of one man on that
day, saying: "We will eat our own food and wear our own clothing; Only let
your name be given us, put an end to our disgrace!" 
2
[2]
 On that day, The branch of the LORD will be
luster and glory, and the fruit of the earth will be honor and splendor for the
survivors of Israel. 
3
[3]
 He who remains in Zion and he that is left in
Jerusalem Will be called holy: every one marked down for life in Jerusalem. 
4
When the Lord washes away the filth of the
daughters of Zion, And purges Jerusalem's blood from her midst with a blast of
searing judgment, 
5
Then will the LORD create, over the whole site
of Mount Zion and over her place of assembly, A smoking cloud by day and a
light of flaming fire by night. 
6
For over all, his glory will be shelter and
protection: shade from the parching heat of day, refuge and cover from storm
and rain.

 [1] Seven women . . . one man: the
disproportion of the sexes due to war leaves the female population almost
without male partners. The women are eager to marry, not for support, but to
avoid the disgrace of being childless.
