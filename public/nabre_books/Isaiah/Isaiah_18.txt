 Ah, land of buzzing
insects, beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, 
2
Sending ambassadors by sea, in papyrus boats on
the waters! Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and bronzed, To a people
dreaded near and far, a nation strong and conquering, whose land is washed by
rivers. 
3
All you who inhabit the world, who dwell on
earth, When the signal is raised on the mountain, look! When the trumpet blows,
listen! 
4
For thus says the LORD to me: I will quietly
look on from where I dwell, Like the glowing heat of sunshine, like a cloud of
dew at harvest time. 
5
Before the vintage, when the flowering is
ended, and the blooms are succeeded by ripening grapes, Then comes the cutting
of branches with pruning hooks and the discarding of the lopped-off shoots. 
6
They shall all be left to the mountain birds of
prey, and to the beasts in the land; The birds of prey shall summer on them and
on them all the beasts of the earth shall winter. 
7
Then will gifts be brought to the LORD of hosts
from a people tall and bronzed, from a people dreaded near and far, a nation
strong and conquering, whose land is washed by rivers - to Mount
Zion where dwells the name of the
LORD of hosts.

 [1-2] Papyrus boats: light and
serviceable vessels made of bundles of papyrus stalks and sealed with pitch.
Egypt, ruled by a dynasty from Ethiopia, had invited Judah to join a coalition
against Assyria, but Isaiah bade the ambassadors return to their own people.

 [1] Land of buzzing insects: the
region of the Upper Nile where these multiplied with great rapidity.
