Introduction
The greatest of
the prophets appeared at a critical moment of Israel's history. The second half
of the eighth century B.C. witnessed the collapse of the northern kingdom under
the hammerlike blows of Assyria (722), while Jerusalem itself saw the army of
Sennacherib drawn up before its walls (701). In the year that Uzziah, king of
Judah, died (742), Isaiah received his call to the prophetic office in the
Temple of Jerusalem. Close attention should be given to Isa 6, where this
divine summons to be the ambassador of the Most High is circumstantially
described.
The vision of the Lord
enthroned in glory stamps an indelible character on Isaiah's ministry and
provides the key to the understanding of his message. The majesty, holiness and
glory of the Lord took possession of his spirit and, conversely, he gained a
new awareness of human pettiness and sinfulness. The enormous abyss between
God's sovereign holiness and man's sin overwhelmed the prophet. Only the
purifying coal of the seraphim could cleanse his lips and prepare him for
acceptance of the call: "Here I am, send me!"
The ministry of Isaiah may
be divided into three periods, covering the reigns of Jotham (742-735), Ahaz
(735-715), and Hezekiah (715-687). To the first period belong, for the most
part, the early oracles (Isa 1-5) which exposed the moral breakdown of Judah
and its capital, Jerusalem. With the accession of Ahaz, the prophet became
adviser to the king, whose throne was threatened by the Syro-Ephraimite
coalition. Rejecting the plea of Isaiah for faith and courage, the weak Ahaz
turned to Assyria for help. From this period came the majority of messianic
oracles found in the section of Immanuel prophecies (Isa 6-12).
Hezekiah succeeded his
father and undertook a religious reform which Isaiah undoubtedly supported. But
the old intrigues began again, and the king was soon won over to the
pro-Egyptian party. Isaiah denounced this "covenant with death" and
again summoned Judah to faith in Yahweh as her only hope. But it was too late;
the revolt had already begun. Assyria acted quickly and her army, after
ravaging Judah, laid siege to Jerusalem (701). "I shut up Hezekiah like a
bird in his cage," boasts the famous inscription of Sennacherib. But
Yahweh delivered the city, as Isaiah had promised: God is the Lord of history,
and Assyria but an instrument in his hands.
Little is known about the
last days of this great religious leader, whose oracles, of singular poetic
beauty and power, constantly reminded his wayward people of their destiny and
the fidelity of Yahweh to his promises.
The complete Book of Isaiah
is an anthology of poems composed chiefly by the great prophet, but also by
disciples, some of whom came many years after Isaiah. In 1-39 most of the
oracles come from Isaiah and faithfully reflect the situation in eighth-century
Judah. To disciples deeply influenced by the prophet belong sections such as
the Apocalypse of Isaiah (Isa 24-27), the oracles against Babylon (Isa 13-14),
and probably the poems of Isa 34-35.
Isa 40-55, sometimes called
the Deutero-Isaiah, are generally attributed to an anonymous poet who
prophesied toward the end of the Babylonian exile. From this section come the
great messianic oracles known as the songs of the Servant, whose mysterious
destiny of suffering and glorification is fulfilled in the passion and
glorification of Christ. Isa 56-66 contain oracles from a later period and were
composed by disciples who inherited the spirit and continued the work of the
great prophet.
