[1]
 The LORD said to me: Take a large
cylinder-seal, and inscribe on it in ordinary letters: "Belonging to
Maher-shalal-hash-baz." 
2
[2]
 And I took reliable witnesses, Uriah the
priest, and Zechariah, son of Jeberechiah. 
3
[3]
 Then I went to the prophetess and she
conceived and bore a son. The LORD said to me: Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz, 
4
for before the child knows how to call his
father or mother by name, the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall
be carried off by the king of Assyria. 
5
Again the LORD spoke to me: 
6
[4]
 Because this people has rejected the waters of
Shiloah that flow gently, And melts with fear before the loftiness of Rezin and
Remaliah's son, 
7
Therefore the LORD raises against them the
waters of the River, great and mighty (the king of Assyria and all his power).
It shall rise above all its channels, and overflow all its banks; 
8
It shall pass into Judah, and flood it all
throughout: up to the neck it shall reach; It shall spread its wings the full
width of your land, Immanuel! 
9
Know, O peoples, and be appalled! Give ear, all
you distant lands! Arm, but be crushed! Arm, but be crushed! 
10
[5]
 Form a plan, and it shall be thwarted; make a
resolve, and it shall not be carried out, for "With us is God!" 
11
For thus said the LORD to me, taking hold of me
and warning me not to walk in the way of this people: 
12
Call not alliance what this people calls
alliance, and fear not, nor stand in awe of what they fear. 
13
But with the LORD of hosts make your alliance
-  for him be your fear and your awe. 
14
Yet he shall be a snare, an obstacle and a
stumbling stone to both the houses of Israel, A trap and a snare to those who
dwell in Jerusalem; 
15
And many among them shall stumble and fall,
broken, snared, and captured. 
16
[6]
 The record is to be folded and the sealed
instruction kept among my disciples. 
17
For I will trust in the LORD, who is hiding his
face from the house of Jacob; yes, I will wait for him. 
18
[7]
 Look at me and the children whom the Lord has
given me: we are signs and portents in Israel from the LORD of hosts who dwells
on Mount Zion. 
19
[8]
 And when they say to you, "Inquire of
mediums and fortune-tellers (who chirp and mutter!); should not a people
inquire of their gods, apply to the dead on behalf of the living?" -  
20
then this document will furnish its
instruction. That kind of thing they will surely say. 
21
[9]
23
First he degraded the land of Zebulun and the
land of Naphtali; 
[10]
 but in the end he has glorified the
seaward road, the land West of the Jordan, the District of the Gentiles.
Anguish has taken wing, dispelled is darkness; for there is no gloom where but
now there was distress. 
1
 [1] Ordinary letters: easily read
by all. Maher-shalal-hash-baz: a symbolic name to be given to another son of
Isaiah (v 3); it means "quick spoils; speedy plunder," and describes
what the Assyrians will do. 
2
 [2] Reliable witnesses: who would
testify that Isaiah had indeed prophesied the future destruction. Uriah the priest:
cf 
⇒
 2 Kings 16:10.
3
 [3] The prophetess: wife of Isaiah.
4
 [6-8] This people: Judah. Waters of
Shiloah: the stream that flows into the pool of Shiloah in Jerusalem, its slow
current symbolizing the silent, divine protection which Judah has rejected. God
will therefore summon the mighty Assyrian army, symbolized by the River
(Euphrates), to devastate Judah, which, however, will not be entirely
destroyed, because it is the land of Immanuel.
5
 [10] The plan of Israel's enemies
will be thwarted because, as the name "Immanuel" signifies, With us
is God.
6
 [16] Kept among my disciples: for
preservation and transmission.
7
 [18] Signs: Isaiah and his sons had
symbolic names.
8
 [19] Chirp and mutter: a mocking
reference to the sounds uttered by necromancers, as if the dead were speaking;
all such practices were forbidden.
9
 [21,22] These verses have been
transposed and placed within 
⇒
 Isaiah 14:25 which
affords the context in which they can be understood.
10
 [23] (23)Zebulun . . . Naphtali: northern Palestine, which
was first to be attacked by the Assyrians; God, however, redeems it, as he
redeems all his people. Seaward road: from Damascus, across southern Galilee to
the Mediterranean Sea. District of the Gentiles: northern Galilee, inhabited by
pagans; cf 
⇒
 Joshua 20:7; 
⇒
9:1; 
⇒
 Matthew 4:15-16 refers to this,
since Jesus began his public mission in Galilee.
