 At that time when Merodach-baladan, son of
Baladan, king of Babylon, heard that Hezekiah had recovered from his sickness,
he sent letters and gifts to him. 
2
Hezekiah was pleased at this, and therefore
showed the messengers his treasury, the silver and gold, the spices and fine
oil, his whole armory, and everything that was in his storerooms; there was
nothing in his house or in his whole realm that he did not show them. 
3
Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah
and asked him, "What did these men say to you? Where did they come
from?" Hezekiah answered, "They came to me from a distant land, from
Babylon." 
4
"What did they see in your house?" he
asked. Hezekiah replied, "They saw everything in my house; there is
nothing in my storerooms that I did not show them." 
5
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the
word of the LORD of hosts: 
6
[2]
 Behold, the days shall come when all that is
in your house, and everything that your fathers have stored up until this day,
shall be carried off to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says the LORD. 
7
Some of your own bodily descendants shall be
taken and made servants in the palace of the king of Babylon."

 Hezekiah replied to Isaiah, "The word of
the LORD which you have spoken is favorable." For he thought, "There
will be peace and security in my lifetime."

Babylon, probably from 721 to 710 B.C., and again for nine months, in 704-703.
This visit of his messengers, certainly before 701, was in reality a political
one. Babylon hoped to lead an anti-Assyrian confederation composed of
neighboring states.

follow a pro-Babylonian policy, instead of trusting in God, it would later be
exiled to Babylon.

not occur in his lifetime.
