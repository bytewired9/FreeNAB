Jerusalem, take off your robe of mourning and
misery; put on the splendor of glory from God forever: 
2
Wrapped in the cloak of justice from God, bear
on your head the mitre that displays the glory of the eternal name. 
3
For God will show all the earth your splendor: 
4
you will be named by God forever the peace of
justice, the glory of God's worship. 
5
Up, Jerusalem! stand upon the heights; look to
the east and see your children Gathered from the east and the west at the word
of the Holy One, rejoicing that they are remembered by God. 
6
Led away on foot by their enemies they left
you: but God will bring them back to you borne aloft in glory as on royal
thrones. 
7
For God has commanded that every lofty mountain
be made low, And that the age-old depths and gorges be filled to level ground,
that Israel may advance secure in the glory of God. 
8
The forests and every fragrant kind of tree
have overshadowed Israel at God's command; 
9
For God is leading Israel in joy by the light
of his glory, with his mercy and justice for company.
