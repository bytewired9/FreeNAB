Introduction
Introduction
The opening
verses of this book ascribe it, or at least its first part, to Baruch, the
well-known secretary of the prophet Jeremiah. It contains five very different
compositions, the first and the last in prose, the others in poetic form. The
prose sections were certainly composed in Hebrew, though the earliest known
form of the book is in Greek.
An observance of the feast
of Booths with a public prayer of penitence and petition
(
⇒
 Baruch 1:15-
⇒
 3:8),
such as is supposed by the introduction (
⇒
1:1-14), would not have been possible during the lifetime of Baruch
after the fall of Jerusalem; this indeed is suggested in the prayer itself
(
⇒
 Baruch 2:26). The prayer is therefore to be
understood as the pious reflection of a later Jewish writer upon the
circumstances of the exiles in Babylon as he knew them from the Book of
Jeremiah. He expresses in their name sentiments called for by the prophet, and
ascribes the wording of these sentiments to the person most intimately
acquainted with Jeremiah's teaching, namely, Baruch. The purpose of this
literary device is to portray for his own and later generations the spirit of
repentance which prompted God to bring the exile to an end.
The lesson thus gained is
followed by a hymn in praise of Wisdom (
⇒
3:9-
⇒
 4:4), exalting the law of Moses as
the unique gift of God to Israel, the observance of which is the way to life
and peace. The ideal city of Jerusalem is then represented
(
⇒
 Baruch 4:5-29) as the solicitous mother of all
exiles, who is assured in the name of God that all her children will be
restored to her (
⇒
4:30-
⇒
 5:9).
The final chapter is really
a separate work, with a title of its own (
⇒
6:1). It is patterned after the earlier letter of Jeremiah (Jer 29),
in the spirit of the warnings against idolatry contained in Jer 10 and Isa 44.
Its earnestness is impressive, but in restating previous inspired teachings at
a later day, it does so with no special literary grace.
Thus the principal
divisions of the book are seen to be:
I.          
Prayer
of the Exiles (
⇒
1:1-
⇒
 3:8) 
II.          
Praise
of Wisdom in the Law of Moses (
⇒
3:9-
⇒
 4:4) 
III.          
Jerusalem
Bewails and Consoles Her Captive Children (
⇒
4:5-29) 
IV.          
Jerusalem
Consoled: The Captivity about To End (
⇒
4:30-
⇒
 5:9) 
V.          
The
Letter of Jeremiah against Idolatry ((Bar) Let 6:1-7)
