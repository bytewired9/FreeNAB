Now these are the words of the scroll which Baruch,
son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, son of Zedekiah, son of Hasadiah, son of
Hilkiah, wrote in Babylon, 
2
[1]
 in the fifth year (on the seventh day of the
month, at the time when the Chaldeans took Jerusalem and burnt it with fire). 
3
And Baruch read the words of this scroll for
Jeconiah, son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, to hear it, as well as all the
people who came to the reading: 
4
[2]
 the nobles, the kings' sons, the elders, and
the whole people, small and great alike - all who lived in Babylon by the river
Sud. 
5
They wept and fasted and prayed before the
LORD, 
6
and collected such funds as each could furnish.
7
These they sent to Jerusalem, to Jehoiakim, son
of Hilkiah, son of Shallum, the priest, and to the priests and the whole people
who were with him in Jerusalem. 
8
[3]
 (This was when he received the vessels of the
house of the Lord that had been removed from the temple, to restore them to the
land of Judah, on the tenth of Sivan. These silver vessels Zedekiah, son of
Josiah, king of Judah, had had made 
9
after Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, carried
off Jeconiah, and the princes, and the skilled workers, and the nobles, and the
people of the land from Jerusalem, as captives, and brought them to Babylon.) 
10
Their message was: "We send you funds,
with which you are to procure holocausts, sin offerings, and frankincense, and
to prepare cereal offerings; offer these on the altar of the LORD our God, 
11
[4]
 and pray for the life of Nebuchadnezzar, king
of Babylon, and that of Belshazzar, his son, that their lifetimes may equal the
duration of the heavens above the earth; 
12
and that the LORD may give us strength, and
light to our eyes, that we may live under the protective shadow of
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and that of Belshazzar, his son, and serve
them long, finding favor in their sight. 
13
"Pray for us also to the LORD, our God;
for we have sinned against the LORD, our God, and the wrath and anger of the
LORD have not yet been withdrawn from us at the present day. 
14
And read out publicly this scroll which we send
you, in the house of the LORD, on the feast day and during the days of
assembly: 
15
"Justice is with the LORD, our God; and we
today are flushed with shame, we men of Judah and citizens of Jerusalem, 
16
that we, with our kings and rulers and priests
and prophets, and with our fathers, 
17
have sinned in the LORD'S sight 
18
and disobeyed him. We have neither heeded the
voice of the LORD, our God, nor followed the precepts which the LORD set before
us. 
19
From the time the LORD led our fathers out of
the land of Egypt until the present day, we have been disobedient to the LORD,
our God, and only too ready to disregard his voice. 
20
And the evils and the curse which the LORD
enjoined upon Moses, his servant, at the time he led our fathers forth from the
land of Egypt to give us the land flowing with milk and honey, cling to us even
today. 
21
For we did not heed the voice of the LORD, our
God, in all the words of the prophets whom he sent us, 
22
but each one of us went off after the devices
of our own wicked hearts, served other gods, and did evil in the sight of the LORD,
our God.

 [2] In the fifth year on the
seventh day of the month: Jerusalem fell on the seventh day of the fifth month;
cf 
⇒
 2 Kings 25:8; 
⇒
 Jeremiah
52:12. Either the text read originally "the fifth month,"
or it refers to the observance of an anniversary of the fall of Jerusalem in
587 B.C. 
2
 [4] The river Sud: one of the
Babylonian canals, not otherwise identified. In ancient non-Biblical Hebrew
fragments discovered in 1952, there is reference to a river "Sur" in
a similar context.
3
 [8-9] He: possibly Baruch; less
likely Jehoiakim . . . the priest (
⇒
 Baruch 1:7), a
member of the high-priestly family not mentioned elsewhere. The silver vessels
here described are distinct from the vessels referred to in
⇒
 2 Kings 25:14 and 
⇒
 Ezra
1:7-9. The author of this note may have thought of the fifth year (v
1) of Zedekiah, in view of 
⇒
 Jeremiah 28:1;
⇒
 29:1-3. A "fifth year," again with no
month mentioned, is given in 
⇒
 Ezekiel 1:2 for the
inaugural vision of Ezekiel's prophetic career.
4
 [11] Nebuchadnezzar . . . Belshazzar, his son: as in
⇒
 Daniel 5:1-2. Later Jewish tradition seems to have
simplified the history of the past by making the last Chaldean ruler of Babylon
the son of the conqueror of Jerusalem.
