 For the leader;
"upon the gittith." A psalm of David. 
2
O LORD, our Lord, how awesome is your name through
all the earth! You have set your majesty above the heavens! 
3
[3]
 Out of the mouths of babes and infants you
have drawn a defense against your foes, to silence enemy and avenger. 
4
When I see your heavens, the work of your
fingers, the moon and stars that you set in place -  
5
[4]
 What are humans that you are mindful of them,
mere mortals that you care for them? 
6
[5]
 Yet you have made them little less than a god,
crowned them with glory and honor. 
7
You have given them rule over the works of your
hands, put all things at their feet: 
8
All sheep and oxen, even the beasts of the
field, 
9
The birds of the air, the fish of the sea, and
whatever swims the paths of the seas. 
10
O LORD, our Lord, how awesome is your name
through all the earth!

 [Psalm 8] While marvelling at the
limitless grandeur of God (
⇒
 Psalm 8:2-3), the
psalmist is struck first by the smallness of human beings in creation
(
⇒
 Psalm 8:4-5), and then by the royal dignity and
power that God has graciously bestowed upon them (
⇒
 Psalm
8:6-9).
2
 [1] Upon the gittith: probably the
title of the melody to which the psalm was to be sung or a musical instrument.

 [3] Babes and infants: the text is
obscure. Some join this line to the last line of 
⇒
 Psalm
8:2 (itself obscure) to read: "(you) whose majesty is exalted
above the heavens / by the mouths of babes and infants." Drawn a defense:
some prefer the Septuagint's "fashioned praise," which is quoted in
⇒
 Matthew 21:16. Enemy and avenger: probably cosmic
enemies. The primeval powers of watery chaos are often personified in poetic
texts (
⇒
 Psalm 74:13-14;
⇒
 89:11; 
⇒
 Job 9:13;
⇒
 26:12-13; Isaiah 51,9).

 [5] Humans . . . mere mortals:
literally, "(mortal) person". . . "son of man (in sense of a
human being, Hebrew 'adam)." The emphasis is on the fragility and
mortality of human beings to whom God has given great dignity.
5
 [6] Little less than a god: Hebrew
'elohim, the ordinary word for "God" or "the gods" or
members of the heavenly court. The Greek version translated 'elohim by
"angel, messenger"; several ancient and modern versions so translate.
The meaning seems to be that God created human beings almost at the level of
the beings in the heavenly world.

 Hebrews 2:9 finds
the eminent fulfillment of this verse in Jesus Christ, who was humbled before
being glorified. Cf also 
⇒
 1 Cor 15:27 where St.
Paul applies to Christ the closing words of 
⇒
 Psalm
8:7.
