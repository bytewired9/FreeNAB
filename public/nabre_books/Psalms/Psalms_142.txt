 A maskil of David, when he
was in the cave. A prayer. 
2
With full voice I cry to the LORD; with full
voice I beseech the LORD. 
3
Before God I pour out my complaint, lay bare my
distress. 
4
My spirit is faint within me, but you know my
path. Along the way I walk they have hidden a trap for me. 
5
I look to my right hand, but no friend is
there. There is no escape for me; no one cares for me. 
6
I cry out to you, LORD, I say, You are my
refuge, my portion in the land of the living. 
7
Listen to my cry for help, for I am brought
very low. Rescue me from my pursuers, for they are too strong for me. 
8
[3]
 Lead me out of my prison, that I may give
thanks to your name. Then the just shall gather around me because you have been
good to me.

 [Psalm 142] In this lament
imploring God for help (
⇒
 Psalm 142:2-4), the
psalmist tells how enemies have set a trap (
⇒
 Psalm
142:4-5), and prays for rescue (
⇒
 Psalm 142:6-8).
The speaker feels utterly alone (
⇒
 Psalm 142:5),
exhausted (
⇒
 Psalm 142:7), and may even be
imprisoned (
⇒
 Psalm 142:7). Prison is possibly a
metaphor for general distress. The last two verses are the vow of praise, made
after receiving an assurance of divine help (
⇒
 Psalm
142:7).

 [8] Then the just shall gather
around me: in the temple, when the psalmist offers a thanksgiving sacrifice.
