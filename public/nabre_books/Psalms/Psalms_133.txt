 A song of ascents. Of
David. How good it is, how pleasant, where the people dwell as one!

 Like precious ointment on the head, running
down upon the beard, Upon the beard of Aaron, upon the collar of his robe.

 Like dew of Hermon coming down upon the
mountains of Zion. There the LORD has lavished blessings, life for evermore!

 [Psalm 133] A benediction over a
peaceful community, most probably the people Israel, but appropriate too for Israelite
families (
⇒
 Psalm 133:1). The history of Israel,
whether of its ancestors in the book of Genesis or of later periods, was a
history of distinct groups struggling to live in unity. Here that unity is
declared blessed, like the holy oils upon the priest Aaron or the dew of the
rainless summer that waters the crops (
⇒
 Psalm
133:2-3).
2
 [1] The people: literally,
"brothers," i.e., male and female members of a kin group or people -
most probably, the people Israel. 
3
 [2] Ointment: oil was used at the
consecration of the high priest (
⇒
 Exodus
30:22-33).
4
 [3] Dew: dew was an important
source of moisture in the dry climate (
⇒
 Genesis
27:28; 
⇒
 Hosea 14:6). Hermon: the majestic
snow-capped mountain visible in the north of Palestine.
