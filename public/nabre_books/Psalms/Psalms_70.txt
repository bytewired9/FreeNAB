 For the leader; of David. For remembrance.

Graciously rescue me, God! Come quickly to help
me, LORD! 
3
Confound and put to shame those who seek my
life. Turn back in disgrace those who desire my ruin. 
4
Let those who say "Aha!" turn back in
their shame.

But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in
you. May those who long for your help always say, "God be glorified!"

Here I am, afflicted and poor. God, come
quickly! You are my help and deliverer. LORD, do not delay!
