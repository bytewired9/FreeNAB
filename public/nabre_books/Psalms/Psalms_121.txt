 A song of ascents. 
[2]
 I
raise my eyes toward the mountains. From where will my help come? 
2
My help comes from the LORD, the maker of
heaven and earth.

God will not allow your foot to slip; your
guardian does not sleep. 
4
Truly, the guardian of Israel never slumbers
nor sleeps.

[3]
 The LORD is your guardian; the LORD is your
shade at your righthand.

night.

The LORD will guard you from all evil, will
always guard your life. 
8
The LORD will guard your coming and going both
now and forever.

 [Psalm 121] A blessing given to
someone embarking on a dangerous journey whether a soldier going on a campaign
or a pilgrim returning home from the temple. People look anxiously at the

⇒
 Psalm

time (
⇒
 Psalm 121:2), that every step is guarded

⇒
 Psalm 121:5-6) God watches
over their every movement (
⇒
 Psalm 121:7-8).

 [5-6] The image of shade, a symbol
of protection, is apt: God as shade protects from the harmful effects that
ancients believed were caused by the sun and moon.
