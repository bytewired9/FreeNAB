A psalm of Asaph. 
[1]
 O God,
the nations have invaded your heritage; they have defiled your holy temple,
have laid Jerusalem in ruins. 
2
They have left the corpses of your servants as
food for the birds of the heavens, the flesh of your faithful for the beasts of
the earth. 
3
They have spilled their blood like water all
around Jerusalem, and no one is left to bury them. 
4
We have become the reproach of our neighbors,
the scorn and derision of those around us. 
5
How long, LORD? Will you be angry forever? Will
your rage keep burning like fire? 
6
Pour out your wrath on nations that reject you,
on kingdoms that do not call on your name, 
7
For they have devoured Jacob, laid waste his
home. 
8
Do not hold past iniquities against us; may
your compassion come quickly, for we have been brought very low. 
9
Help us, God our savior, for the glory of your
name. Deliver us, pardon our sins for your name's sake. 
10
Why should the nations say, "Where is
their God?" Before our eyes make clear to the nations that you avenge the
blood of your servants. 
11
Let the groans of prisoners come before you; by
your great power free those doomed to death. 
12
Lord, inflict on our neighbors seven fold the
disgrace they inflicted on you. 
13
Then we, your people, the sheep of your
pasture, will give thanks to you forever; through all ages we will declare your
praise.

 [Psalm 79] A communal lament
complaining that the nations have defiled the temple and murdered the holy
people, leaving their corpses unburied (
⇒
 Psalm
79:1-4). The occasion is probably the destruction of Jerusalem by the
Babylonian army in 587 B.C. The people ask how long the withdrawal of divine
favor will last (
⇒
 Psalm 79:5), pray for action now
(
⇒
 Psalm 79:6-7), and admit that their own sins have
brought about the catastrophe (
⇒
 Psalm 79:8-9). They
seek to persuade God to act for reasons of honor: the nations who do not call
upon the Name are running amok (
⇒
 Psalm 79:6); the
divine honor is compromised (
⇒
 Psalm 79:1,
⇒
 10, 
⇒
 12); God's own
servants suffer (
⇒
 Psalm 79:2-4,
⇒
 11).
