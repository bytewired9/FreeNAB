[1]
 A song of ascents. 
[2]
 The
LORD answered me when I called in my distress: 
2
LORD, deliver me from lying lips, from
treacherous tongues. 
3
[3]
 What will the Lord inflict on you, O
treacherous tongue, and what more besides? 
4
[4]
 A warrior's sharpened arrows and fiery coals
of brush wood! 
5
[5]
 Alas, I was an alien in Meshech, I lived near
the tents of Kedar! 
6
Too long did I live among those who hated
peace. 
7
When I spoke of peace, they were for war.
1
 [Psalm 120] A thanksgiving,
reporting divine rescue (Psalm 120:10) yet
with fervent prayer for further protection against lying attackers
(
⇒
 Psalm 120:2-4). The psalmist is acutely conscious
of living away from God's own land where divine peace prevails
(
⇒
 Psalm 120:5-7).
2
 [1] Song of ascents: Psalm 120-134
all begin with this superscription. Most probably these fifteen psalms once
formed a collection of psalms sung when pilgrims went to Jerusalem, since one
"ascended" to Jerusalem (
⇒
 1 Kings
12:28; 
⇒
 Psalm 24:3;
⇒
 122:4; 
⇒
 Luke 2:42) or
to the house of God or to an altar (
⇒
 1 Kings
12:33; 
⇒
 2 Kings 23:2;
⇒
 Psalm 24:3). Less probable is the explanation that
these psalms were sung by the exiles when they "ascended" to
Jerusalem from Babylonia (cf 
⇒
 Ezra 7:9). The idea,
found in the Mishnah, that the fifteen steps on which the Levites sang
corresponded to these fifteen psalms (Middot 2:5) must underlie the Vulgate
translation canticum graduum, "song of the steps" or "gradual
song." 
3
 [3] More besides: a common curse
formula in Hebrew was "May the Lord do such and such evils to you [the
evils being specified], and add still more to them." Cf
⇒
 1 Sam 3:17; 
⇒
 14:44;
⇒
 25:22. Here the psalmist is at a loss for a
suitable malediction.
4
 [4] Coals of brushwood: coals made
from the stalk of the broom plant burn with intense heat. The psalmist thinks
of lighted coals cast at his enemies.
5
 [5] Meshech was in the far north
(
⇒
 Genesis 10:2) and Kedar was a tribe of the north
Arabian desert (
⇒
 Genesis 25:13). The psalmist may
be thinking generally of all aliens living among inhospitable peoples.
