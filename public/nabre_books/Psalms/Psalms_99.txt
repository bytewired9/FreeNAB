 The LORD is king, the
peoples tremble; God is enthroned on the cherubim, the earth quakes. 
2
The LORD is great on Zion, exalted above all
the peoples. 
3
Let them praise your great and awesome name:
Holy is God! 
4
O mighty king, lover of justice, you alone have
established fairness; you have created just rule in Jacob. 
5
[3]
 Exalt the LORD, our God; bow down before his footstool;
holy is God! 
6
Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel
among those who called on God's name; they called on the LORD, who answered
them. 
7
From the pillar of cloud God spoke to them; they
kept the decrees, the law they received. 
8
O LORD, our God, you answered them; you were a
forgiving God, though you punished their offenses. 
9
Exalt the LORD, our God; bow down before his
holy mountain; holy is the LORD, our God.

 [Psalm 99] A hymn to God as the
king whose grandeur is most clearly seen on Mount Zion
(
⇒
 Psalm 99:2) and in the laws given to Israel
(
⇒
 Psalm 99:4). Israel is special because of God's
word of justice, which was mediated by the revered speakers, Moses, Aaron, and
Samuel (
⇒
 Psalm 99:6-8). The poem is structured by
the threefold statement that God is holy (
⇒
 Psalm
99:3, 5, 9)
and by the twice-repeated command to praise (
⇒
 Psalm
99:5, 9).
