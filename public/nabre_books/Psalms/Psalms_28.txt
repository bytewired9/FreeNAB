1
Of David. To you, LORD, I call; my Rock, do not
be deaf to me. If you fail to answer me, I will join those who go down to the
pit. 
2
[1]
 Hear the sound of my pleading when I cry to
you, lifting my hands toward your holy place. 
3
Do not drag me off with the wicked, with those
who do wrong, Who speak peace to their neighbors though evil is in their
hearts. 
4
Repay them for their deeds, for the evil that
they do. For the work of their hands repay them; give them what they deserve. 
5
They pay no heed to the LORD'S works, to the
deeds of God's hands. God will tear them down, never to be rebuilt. 
6
[2]
 Blessed be the LORD, who has heard the sound
of my pleading. 
7
The LORD is my strength and my shield, in whom
my heart trusted and found help. So my heart rejoices; with my song I praise my
God. 
8
[3]
 LORD, you are the strength of your people, the
saving refuge of your anointed king. 
9
Save your people, bless your inheritance; feed
and sustain them forever!

 [2] Your holy place: the innermost
part of the temple, the holy of holies, containing the ark. Cf
⇒
 1 Kings 6:16,
⇒
 19-23; 
⇒
 8:6-8.

 [6] The psalmist shifts to fervent
thanksgiving, probably responding to a priestly or prophetic oracle in
⇒
 Psalm 28:5cd (not usually transmitted) assuring
the worshiper that the prayer has been heard.

 [8] Your people . . . your anointed
king: salvation is more than individual, affecting all the people and their
God-given leader.
