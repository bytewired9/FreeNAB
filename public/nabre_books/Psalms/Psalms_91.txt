 You who dwell in the
shelter of the Most High, who abide in the shadow of the Almighty, 
2
Say to the LORD, "My refuge and fortress,
my God in whom I trust." 
3
God will rescue you from the fowler's snare,
from the destroying plague, 
4
Will shelter you with pinions, spread wings
that you may take refuge; God's faithfulness is a protecting shield. 
5
You shall not fear the terror of the night nor
the arrow that flies by day, 
6
Nor the pestilence that roams in darkness, nor
the plague that ravages at noon. 
7
Though a thousand fall at your side, ten
thousand at your right hand, near you it shall not come. 
8
You need simply watch; the punishment of the
wicked you will see. 
9
You have the LORD for your refuge; you have
made the Most High your stronghold. 
10
No evil shall befall you, no affliction come
near your tent. 
11
[3]
 For God commands the angels to guard you in
all your ways. 
12
With their hands they shall support you, lest
you strike your foot against a stone. 
13
You shall tread upon the asp and the viper,
trample the lion and the dragon. 
14
Whoever clings to me I will deliver; whoever
knows my name I will set on high. 
15
All who call upon me I will answer; I will be
with them in distress; I will deliver them and give them honor. 
16
With length of days I will satisfy them and
show them my saving power.

 [Psalm 91] A prayer of someone who
has taken refuge in the security of the temple (
⇒
 Psalm
91:1-2). The psalmist is confident that God's presence will protect
the people in every dangerous situation (
⇒
 Psalm
91:3-13). The final verses are an oracle of salvation promising
salvation to those who trust in God (
⇒
 Psalm
91:14-16).

 [1] The shelter of the Most High:
basically "hiding place" but in the psalms a designation for the
protected temple precincts. Cf 
⇒
 Psalm 27:5;
⇒
 31:21; 
⇒
 61:5. The
shadow of the Almighty: literally, "the shadow of the wings of the
Almighty." Cf 
⇒
 Psalm 17:8;
⇒
 36:8; 
⇒
 57:2;
⇒
 63:8. 
⇒
 Psalm 91:4
makes clear that the shadow is an image of the safety afforded by the outstretched
wings of the cherubim in the holy of holies.
