[1]
 A psalm of the Korahites. A song. The LORD
loves the city founded on holy mountains, 
2
[2]
 Loves the gates of Zion more than any dwelling
in Jacob. 
3
Glorious things are said of you, O city of God!
Selah 
4
From Babylon and Egypt I count those who
acknowledge the LORD. Philistia, Ethiopia, Tyre, of them it can be said:
"This one was born there." 
5
[3]
 But of Zion it must be said: "They all
were born here." The Most High confirms this; 
6
the Lord notes in the register of the peoples:
"This one was born here." Selah 
7
So all sing in their festive dance:
"Within you is my true home."

 [Psalm 87] A song of Zion, like
Psalms 46; 48; 76; 132. After the Exile of the sixth century B.C., diaspora
Jews from all over the world (
⇒
 Psalm 87:4) made the
long pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the city of God (
⇒
 Psalm
87:1-3). Such Jews may have hailed from distant lands, but the psalm
sees them as children of Zion (
⇒
 Psalm 87:5-7). The
original occasion may have been Pentecost, which always attracted a large
number of diaspora Jews.

 [2] The gates: the city itself, a
common Hebrew idiom.
3
 [5-6] The bond between the exile
and the holy city was so strong as to override the exile's citizenship of
lesser cities.
