 O God, by your name save me. By your strength
defend my cause.

O God, hear my prayer. Listen to the words of
my mouth.

ruthless seek my life; they do not keep God before them. Selah

God is present as my helper; the Lord sustains
my life. 
7
Turn back the evil upon my foes; in your
faithfulness, destroy them. 
8
Then I will offer you generous sacrifice and
praise your gracious name, LORD, 
9
Because it has rescued me from every trouble,
and my eyes look down on my foes.

person under attack calls directly upon God for help (

 Psalm 54:6-7). The
psalm ends with a serene promise to return thanks (

 Psalm
54:7[8-9]).
