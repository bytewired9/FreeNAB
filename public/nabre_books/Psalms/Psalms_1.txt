[2]
 Happy those who do not
follow the counsel of the wicked, Nor go the way of sinners, nor sit in company
with scoffers. 
2
[3]
 Rather, the law of the LORD is their joy;
God's law they study day and night. 
3
They are like a tree planted near streams of
water, that yields its fruit in season; Its leaves never wither; whatever they
do prospers. 
4
[4]
 But not the wicked! They are like chaff driven
by the wind. 
5
Therefore the wicked will not survive judgment,
nor will sinners in the assembly of the just. 
6
The LORD watches over the way of the just, but
the way of the wicked leads to ruin. 
1
 [Psalm 1] A preface to the whole
Book of Psalms, contrasting with striking similes the destiny of the good and
the wicked. The psalm views life as activity, as choosing either the good or
the bad. Each "way" brings its inevitable consequences. The wise
through their good actions will experience rootedness and life, and the wicked,
rootlessness and death.

 [1] Those: literally, "the
man." That word is used here and in many of the Psalms as typical, and
therefore is translated "they." The way: a common biblical term for
manner of living or moral conduct (
⇒
 Psalm 32:8;
⇒
 101:2, 6; 
⇒
 Proverb
2:20; 
⇒
 1 Kings 8:36).

 [2] The law of the LORD: either the
Torah, the first five books of the Bible, or, more probably, divine teaching or
instruction.

 [4] The wicked: those who by their
actions distance themselves from God's life-giving presence.
