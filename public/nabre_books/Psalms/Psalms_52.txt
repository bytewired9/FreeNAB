 For the leader. A maskil of David, 
2
when Doeg the Edomite went and told Saul,
"David went to the house of Ahimelech." 
3
Why do you glory in evil, you scandalous liar?
All day long 
4
you plot destruction; your tongue is like a
sharpened razor, you skillful deceiver. 
5
You love evil rather than good, lies rather
than honest speech. Selah 
6
You love any word that destroys, you deceitful
tongue. 
7
Now God will strike you down, leave you crushed
forever, Pluck you from your tent, uproot you from the land of the living.
Selah 
8
The righteous will look on with awe; they will
jeer and say: 
9
"That one did not take God as a refuge,
but trusted in great wealth, relied on devious plots." 
10
[2]
 But I, like an olive tree in the house of God,
trust in God's faithful love forever. 
11
I will praise you always for what you have
done. I will proclaim before the faithful that your name is good.

 [Psalm 52] A condemnation of the
powerful and arrogant (
⇒
 Psalm 52:3-6), who bring
down upon themselves God's judgment (
⇒
 Psalm 52:7).
The just, those who trust in God alone, are gladdened and strengthened by the
downfall of their traditional enemies (
⇒
 Psalm
52:8-9).

 [10] Like an olive tree: the
