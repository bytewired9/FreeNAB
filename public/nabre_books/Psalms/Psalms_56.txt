 For the director.
According to Yonath elem rehoqim. A miktam of David, when the Philistines
seized him at Gath. 
2
Have mercy on me, God, for I am treated
harshly; attackers press me all the day. 
3
My foes treat me harshly all the day; yes, many
are my attackers. O Most High, 
4
when I am afraid, in you I place my trust. 
5
God, I praise your promise; in you I trust, I
do not fear. What can mere flesh do to me? 
6
All the day they foil my plans; their every
thought is of evil against me. 
7
They hide together in ambush; they watch my
every step; they lie in wait for my life. 
8
They are evil; watch them, God! Cast the
nations down in your anger! 
9
[3]
 My wanderings you have noted; are my tears not
stored in your vial, recorded in your book? 
10
My foes turn back when I call on you. This I
know: God is on my side. 
11
God, I praise your promise; 
12
in you I trust, I do not fear. What can mere
mortals do to me? 
13
I have made vows to you, God; with offerings I
will fulfill them, 
14
Once you have snatched me from death, kept my
feet from stumbling, That I may walk before God in the light of the living.

 [Psalm 56] Beset physically (
⇒
 Psalm
56:2-3) and psychologically (
⇒
 Psalm
56:6-7), the psalmist maintains a firm confidence in God
(
⇒
 Psalm 56:5, 
⇒
 9-10).
Nothing will prevent the psalmist from keeping the vow to give thanks for God's
gift of life (
⇒
 Psalm 56:13). A refrain
(
⇒
 Psalm 56:5, 
⇒
 11-12)
divides the psalm in two equal parts.

words probably designating the melody to which the psalm was to be sung.

 [9] Are my tears not stored in your
vial: a unique saying in the Old Testament. The context suggests that the tears
are saved because they are precious; God puts a high value on each of the
psalmist's troubles.
