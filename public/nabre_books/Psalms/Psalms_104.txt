[1]
 Bless the LORD, my soul! LORD, my God, you are
great indeed! You are clothed with majesty and glory, 
2
robed in light as with a cloak. You spread out
the heavens like a tent; 
3
[2]
 you raised your palace upon the waters. You
make the clouds your chariot; you travel on the wings of the wind. 
4
You make the winds your messengers; flaming
fire, your ministers. 
5
[3]
 You fixed the earth on its foundation, never
to be moved. 
6
The ocean covered it like a garment; above the
mountains stood the waters. 
7
At your roar they took flight; at the sound of
your thunder they fled. 
8
They rushed up the mountains, down the valleys
to the place you had fixed for them. 
9
You set a limit they cannot pass; never again
will they cover the earth. 
10
You made springs flow into channels that wind
among the mountains. 
11
They give drink to every beast of the field;
here wild asses quench their thirst. 
12
Beside them the birds of heaven nest; among the
branches they sing. 
13
You water the mountains from your palace; by
your labor the earth abounds. 
14
You raise grass for the cattle and plants for
our beasts of burden. You bring bread from the earth, 
15
and wine to gladden our hearts, Oil to make our
faces gleam, food to build our strength. 
16
[4]
 The trees of the LORD drink their fill, the
cedars of Lebanon, which you planted. 
17
There the birds build their nests; junipers are
the home of the stork. 
18
The high mountains are for wild goats; the
rocky cliffs, a refuge for badgers. 
19
You made the moon to mark the seasons, the sun
that knows the hour of its setting. 
20
You bring darkness and night falls, then all
the beasts of the forest roam abroad. 
21
Young lions roar for prey; they seek their food
from God. 
22
When the sun rises, they steal away and rest in
their dens. 
23
People go forth to their work, to their labor
till evening falls. 
24
How varied are your works, LORD! In wisdom you
have wrought them all; the earth is full of your creatures. 
25
Look at the sea, great and wide! It teems with
countless beings, living things both large and small. 
26
[5]
 Here ships ply their course; here Leviathan,
your creature, plays. 
27
All of these look to you to give them food in
due time. 
28
When you give to them, they gather; when you
open your hand, they are well filled. 
29
[6]
 When you hide your face, they are lost. When
you take away their breath, they perish and return to the dust from which they
came. 
30
When you send forth your breath, they are
created, and you renew the face of the earth. 
31
May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may
the LORD be glad in these works! 
32
If God glares at the earth, it trembles; if God
touches the mountains, they smoke! 
33
I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will
sing praise to my God while I live. 
34
May my theme be pleasing to God; I will rejoice
in the LORD. 
35
[7]
 May sinners vanish from the earth, and the
wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, my soul! Hallelujah!
1
 [Psalm 104] A hymn praising God who
easily and skillfully made rampaging waters and primordial night into a world
vibrant with life. The psalmist describes God's splendor in the heavens
(
⇒
 Psalm 104:1-4), how the chaotic waters were
tamed to fertilize and feed the world (
⇒
 104:5-18),
and how primordial night was made into a gentle time of refreshment
(
⇒
 Psalm 104:19-23). The picture is like
⇒
 Genesis 1:1-2: a dark and watery chaos is made dry
and lighted so that creatures might live. The psalmist reacts to the beauty of
creation with awe (
⇒
 Psalm 104:24-34). May sin not
deface God's work (
⇒
 Psalm 104:35)! 
2
 [3] Your palace upon the waters:
God's heavenly dwelling above the upper waters of the sky. Cf
⇒
 Genesis 1:6-7; 
⇒
 Psalm 29:10.
3
 [5-9] God places the gigantic disk
of the earth securely on its foundation and then, as a warrior, chases away the
enveloping waters and confines them under, above, and around the earth.
4
 [16-18] Even the exotic flora and
fauna of the high mountains of the Lebanon range receive adequate water.
5
 [26] Leviathan: a sea monster
symbolizing primeval chaos. Cf 
⇒
 Psalm 74:14;
⇒
 Isaiah 27:1; 
⇒
 Job 40:25.
God does not destroy chaos but makes it part of the created order.
6
 [29-30] On one level, the spirit
(or wind) of God is the fall and winter rains that provide food for all
creatures. On another, it is the breath (or spirit) of God that makes beings
live.
7
 [35] Hallelujah: a frequent word in
the last third of the Psalter. The word combines the plural imperative of
praise (hallelu) with an abbreviated form of the divine name Yah(weh).
