Of David. 
[1]
 Grant me justice, LORD! I have walked without blame. In the LORD I have
trusted; I have not faltered. 
2
Test me, LORD, and try me; search my heart and
mind. 
3
Your love is before my eyes; I walk guided by
your faithfulness. 
4
I do not sit with deceivers, nor with
hypocrites do I mingle. 
5
I hate the company of evildoers; with the
wicked I do not sit. 
6
[2]
 I will wash my hands in innocence and walk
round your altar, LORD, 
7
Lifting my voice in thanks, recounting all your
wondrous deeds. 
8
LORD, I love the house where you dwell, the
tenting-place of your glory. 
9
Do not take me away with sinners, nor my life
with the violent. 
10
Their hands carry out their schemes; their
right hands are full of bribes. 
11
But I walk without blame; redeem me, be
gracious to me!
