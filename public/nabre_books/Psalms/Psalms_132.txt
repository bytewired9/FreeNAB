 A song of ascents. 
[2]
 LORD,
remember David and all his anxious care; 
2
[3]
 How he swore an oath to the LORD, vowed to the
Mighty One of Jacob: 
3
"I will not enter the house where I live,
nor lie on the couch where I sleep; 
4
I will give my eyes no sleep, my eyelids no
rest, 
5
Till I find a home for the LORD, a dwelling for
the Mighty One of Jacob." 
6
[4]
 "We have heard of it in Ephrathah; we
have found it in the fields of Jaar. 
7
Let us enter God's dwelling; let us worship at
God's footstool." 
8
"Arise, LORD, come to your resting place,
you and your majestic ark. 
9
Your priests will be clothed with justice; your
faithful will shout for joy." 
10
For the sake of David your servant, do not
reject your anointed. 
11
The LORD swore an oath to David, a pledge never
to be broken: "Your own offspring I will set upon your throne. 
12
If your sons observe my covenant, the laws I
shall teach them, Their sons, in turn, shall sit forever on your throne." 
13
Yes, the LORD has chosen Zion, desired it for a
dwelling: 
14
"This is my resting place forever; here I
will dwell, for I desire it. 
15
I will bless Zion with meat; its poor I will
fill with bread. 
16
I will clothe its priests with blessing; its
faithful shall shout for joy. 
17
[5]
 There I will make a horn sprout for David's
line; I will set a lamp for my anointed. 
18
His foes I will clothe with shame, but on him
my crown shall gleam."

 [Psalm 132] A song for a liturgical
ceremony in which the ark, the throne of Israel's God, was carried in
procession to the temple. The singer asks that David's care for the proper
housing of the ark be regarded with favor (
⇒
 Psalm
132:1-5), and tells how it was brought to Jerusalem
(
⇒
 Psalm 132:6-10). There follows God's promise of
favor to the Davidic dynasty (
⇒
 Psalm 132:11-12)
and to Zion (
⇒
 Psalm 132:13-17). The transfer of
the ark to the tent in Jerusalem is described in 2 Sam 6.
2
 [1] All his anxious care: to build
the temple. Cf 
⇒
 2 Sam 7:1-17 and
⇒
 1 Kings 8:17. 
3
 [2,5] Mighty One of Jacob: one of
the titles of Israel's God. Cf 
⇒
 Genesis 49:24;
⇒
 Isaiah 49:26;
⇒
 60:16.
4
 [6] Ephrathah: the homeland of
David. Cf 
⇒
 Ruth 4:11. The fields of Jaar: poetic
for Kiriath-jearim, a town west of Jerusalem, where the ark remained for
several generations. Cf 
⇒
 1 Sam 7:1-2 ;
⇒
 2 Sam 6:2; 
⇒
 1 Chron
13:5-6.
5
 [17] A horn sprout for David's
line: the image of the horn, a symbol of strength, is combined with that of a
"sprout," a term used for the Davidic descendant (cf
⇒
 Jeremiah 23:5;
⇒
 33:15; 
⇒
 Zechariah 3:8;
⇒
 6:12). Early Christians referred the latter
designation to Christ as son of David (
⇒
 Luke 1:69).
