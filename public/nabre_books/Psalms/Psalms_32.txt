Of David. A maskil. 
[1]
 Happy
the sinner whose fault is removed, whose sin is forgiven. 
2
Happy those to whom the LORD imputes no guilt,
in whose spirit is no deceit. 
3
[2]
 As long as I kept silent, my bones wasted
away; I groaned all the day. 
4
For day and night your hand was heavy upon me;
my strength withered as in dry summer heat. Selah 
5
Then I declared my sin to you; my guilt I did
not hide. I said, "I confess my faults to the LORD," and you took
away the guilt of my sin. Selah 
6
[3]
 Thus should all your faithful pray in time of
distress. Though flood waters threaten, they will never reach them. 
7
You are my shelter; from distress you keep me;
with safety you ring me round. Selah 
8
I will instruct you and show you the way you
should walk, give you counsel and watch over you. 
9
Do not be senseless like horses or mules; with
bit and bridle their temper is curbed, else they will not come to you. 
10
Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but love
surrounds those who trust in the LORD. 
11
Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, you just;
exult, all you upright of heart. 
1
 [Psalm 32] An individual
thanksgiving and the second of the seven Penitential Psalms (cf Psalm 6). The
opening declaration - the forgiven are blessed (
⇒
 Psalm
32:1-2) - arises from the psalmist's own experience. At one time the
psalmist was stubborn and closed, a victim of sin's power
(
⇒
 Psalm 32:3-4), and then became open to the
forgiving God (
⇒
 Psalm 32:5-7). Sin here, as often
in the Bible, is not only the personal act of rebellion against God but also
the consequences of that act - frustration and waning of vitality. Having been
rescued, the psalmist can teach others the joys of justice and the folly of sin
(
⇒
 Psalm 32:8-11).

 [3] I kept silent: did not confess
the sin before God.

waters surrounding the earth, a metaphor for danger.
