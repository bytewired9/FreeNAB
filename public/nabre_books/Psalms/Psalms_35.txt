[1]
 Of David. 
[2]
 Oppose, LORD,
those who oppose me; war upon those who make war upon me. 
2
Take up the shield and buckler; rise up in my
defense. 
3
Brandish lance and battle-ax against my
pursuers. Say to my heart, "I am your salvation." 
4
Let those who seek my life be put to shame and
disgrace. Let those who plot evil against me be turned back and confounded.
5
Make them like chaff before the wind, with the
angel of the LORD driving them on. 
6
Make their way slippery and dark, with the
angel of the LORD pursuing them. 
7
Without cause they set their snare for me;
without cause they dug a pit for me. 
8
Let ruin overtake them unawares; let the snare
they have set catch them; let them fall into the pit they have dug. 
9
Then I will rejoice in the LORD, exult in God's
salvation. 
10
My very bones shall say, "O LORD, who is
like you, Who rescue the afflicted from the powerful, the afflicted and needy
from the despoiler?" 
11
Malicious witnesses come forward, accuse me of
things I do not know. 
12
They repay me evil for good and I am all alone.
13
[3]
 Yet I, when they were ill, put on sackcloth,
afflicted myself with fasting, sobbed my prayers upon my bosom. 
14
I went about in grief as for my brother, bent
in mourning as for my mother. 
15
Yet when I stumbled they gathered with glee,
gathered against me like strangers. They slandered me without ceasing; 
16
without respect they mocked me, gnashed their
teeth against me. 
17
Lord, how long will you look on? Save me from
roaring beasts, my precious life from lions! 
18
Then I will thank you in the great assembly; I
will praise you before the mighty throng. 
19
Do not let lying foes smirk at me, my
undeserved enemies wink knowingly. 
20
They speak no words of peace, but against the
quiet in the land they fashion deceitful speech. 
21
They open wide their mouths against me. They
say, "Aha! Good! Our eyes relish the sight!" 
22
You see this, LORD; do not be silent; Lord, do
not withdraw from me. 
23
Awake, be vigilant in my defense, in my cause,
my God and my Lord. 
24
Defend me because you are just, LORD; my God,
do not let them gloat over me. 
25
Do not let them say in their hearts, "Aha!
Just what we wanted!" Do not let them say, "We have devoured that
one!" 
26
Put to shame and confound all who relish my
misfortune. Clothe with shame and disgrace those who lord it over me. 
27
But let those who favor my just cause shout for
joy and be glad. May they ever say, "Exalted be the LORD who delights in
the peace of his loyal servant." 
28
Then my tongue shall recount your justice,
declare your praise, all the day long.

 [Psalm 35] A lament of a person
betrayed by friends. The psalmist prays that the evildoers be publicly exposed
as unjust (
⇒
 Psalm 35:1-8), and gives thanks in
anticipation of vindication (
⇒
 Psalm 35:9-10). Old
friends are the enemies (
⇒
 Psalm 35:11-16). May
their punishment come quickly (
⇒
 Psalm 35:17-21)!
The last part (
⇒
 Psalm 35:22-26) echoes the opening
in praying for the destruction of the psalmist's persecutors. The psalm may
appear vindictive, but one must keep in mind that the psalmist is praying for
public redress now of a public injustice. There is at this time no belief in an
afterlife in which justice will be redressed.
2
 [1-6] The mixture of judicial,
martial, and hunting images shows that the language is figurative. The actual
injustice is false accusation of serious crimes (
⇒
 Psalm
35:11, 
⇒
 15,
⇒
 20-21). The psalmist seeks lost honor through a
trial before God.
