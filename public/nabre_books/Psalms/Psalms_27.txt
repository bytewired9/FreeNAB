1
Of David 
[1]
 The LORD is my
light and my salvation; whom do I fear? The LORD is my life's refuge; of whom
am I afraid? 
2
[2]
 When evildoers come at me to devour my flesh,
These my enemies and foes themselves stumble and fall. 
3
Though an army encamp against me, my heart does
not fear; Though war be waged against me, even then do I trust. 
4
One thing I ask of the LORD; this I seek: To
dwell in the LORD'S house all the days of my life, To gaze on the LORD'S
beauty, to visit his temple. 
5
For God will hide me in his shelter in time of
trouble, Will conceal me in the cover of his tent; and set me high upon a rock.
6
Even now my head is held high above my enemies
on every side! I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will
sing and chant praise to the LORD. 
7
I Hear my voice, LORD, when I call; have mercy
on me and answer me. 
8
[3]
 "Come," says my heart, "seek
God's face"; your face, LORD, do I seek! 
9
Do not hide your face from me; do not repel
your servant in anger. You are my help; do not cast me off; do not forsake me,
God my savior! 
10
Even if my father and mother forsake me, the LORD
will take me in. 
11
LORD, show me your way; lead me on a level path
because of my enemies. 
12
Do not abandon me to the will of my foes;
malicious and lying witnesses have risen against me. 
13
[4]
 But I believe I shall enjoy the LORD'S
goodness in the land of the living. 
14
Wait for the LORD, take courage; be
stouthearted, wait for the LORD!

 [Psalm 27] Tradition has handed
down the two sections of the psalm (
⇒
 Psalm 27:1-6;
7-14) as one psalm, though each part could be understood as complete in itself.
Asserting boundless hope that God will bring rescue (
⇒
 Psalm
27:1-3), the psalmist longs for the presence of God in the temple,
protection from all enemies (
⇒
 Psalm 27:4-6). In
part B there is a clear shift in tone (
⇒
 Psalm
27:7-12); the climax of the poem comes with "I believe"
(
⇒
 Psalm 27:13), echoing "I trust"
(
⇒
 Psalm 27:3).

 [2] To devour my flesh: the
psalmist's enemies are rapacious beasts (
⇒
 Psalm 7:3;
⇒
 17:12; 
⇒
 22:14,
⇒
 17).

 [8] Seek God's face (literally:
"to seek his face"): to commune with God in the temple. The idiom is
derived from the practice of journeying to sacred places. Cf
⇒
 Hosea 5:15; 
⇒
 2 Sam
21:1; 
⇒
 Psalm 24:6.

 [13] In the land of the living: or
"in the land of life," an epithet of the Jerusalem temple
(
⇒
 Psalm 52:7; 
⇒
 116:9;
⇒
 Isaiah 38:11), where the faithful had access to
the life-giving presence of God.
