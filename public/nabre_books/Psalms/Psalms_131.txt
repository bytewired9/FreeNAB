[1]
 A song of ascents. Of David. LORD, my heart is
not proud; nor are my eyes haughty. I do not busy myself with great matters,
with things too sublime for me. 
2
Rather, I have stilled my soul, hushed it like
a weaned child. Like a weaned child on its mother's lap, so is my soul within
me. 
3
Israel, hope in the LORD, now and forever.

 [Psalm 131] A song of trust, in
which the psalmist gives up self-sufficiency (
⇒
 Psalm
131:1), like a babe enjoying the comfort of its mother's lap
(
⇒
 Psalm 131:2), thus providing a model for
Israel's faith (
⇒
 Psalm 131:3).
