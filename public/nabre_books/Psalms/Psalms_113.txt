Hallelujah! 
[1]
 Praise, you servants
of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. 
2
Blessed be the name of the LORD both now and
forever. 
3
From the rising of the sun to its setting let
the name of the LORD be praised. 
4
High above all nations is the LORD; above the
heavens God's glory. 
5
Who is like the LORD, our God enthroned on
high, 
6
looking down on heaven and earth? 
7
The LORD raises the needy from the dust, lifts
the poor from the ash heap, 
8
Seats them with princes, the princes of the
people, 
9
Gives the childless wife a home, the joyful
mother of children. Hallelujah!

 [Psalm 113] A hymn exhorting the
congregation to praise God's name, i.e., the way in which God is present in the
world; the name is mentioned three times in 
⇒
 Psalm 113:1-3.
The divine name is especially honored in the temple (
⇒
 Psalm
113:1) but its recognition is not limited by time
(
⇒
 Psalm 113:2) and space
(
⇒
 Psalm 113:3), for God is everywhere active
(
⇒
 Psalm 113:4-5) especially in rescuing the lowly
faithful (
⇒
 Psalm 113:7-9).
