 For the leader; according
to Muth Labben. A psalm of David. 
2
I will praise you, LORD, with all my heart; I
will declare all your wondrous deeds. 
3
I will delight and rejoice in you; I will sing
hymns to your name, Most High. 
4
For my enemies turn back; they stumble and
perish before you. 
5
You upheld my right and my cause, seated on
your throne, judging justly. 
6
You rebuked the nations, you destroyed the
wicked; their name you blotted out for all time 
7
The enemies have been ruined forever; you
destroyed their cities; their memory has perished. 
8
The LORD rules forever, has set up a throne for
judgment. 
9
It is God who governs the world with justice,
who judges the peoples with fairness. 
10
The LORD is a stronghold for the oppressed,
stronghold in times of trouble. 
11
Those who honor your name trust in you; you
never forsake those who seek you, LORD. 
12
Sing hymns to the LORD enthroned on Zion;
proclaim God's deeds among the nations! 
13
For the avenger of bloodshed remembers, does
not forget the cry of the afflicted. 
14
Have mercy on me, LORD; see how my foes afflict
me! You alone can raise me from the gates of death. 
15
[3]
 Then I will declare all your praises, sing
joyously of your salvation in the gates of daughter Zion. 
16
The nations fall into the pit they dig; in the
snare they hide, their own foot is caught. 
17
[4]
 The LORD is revealed in this divine rule: by
the deeds they do the wicked are trapped. Higgaion. Selah 
18
To Sheol the wicked will depart, all the
nations that forget God. 
19
The needy will never be forgotten, nor will the
hope of the afflicted ever fade. 
20
Arise, LORD, let no mortal prevail; let the
nations be judged in your presence. 
21
Strike them with terror, LORD; show the nations
they are mere mortals. Selah

 [Psalms 9-10] Psalm 9 and Psalm 10
in the Hebrew text have been transmitted as separate poems but they actually
form a single acrostic poem and are so transmitted in the Greek and Latin
tradition. Each verse of the two psalms begins with a successive letter of the
Hebrew alphabet (though several letters have no corresponding stanza). The
psalm states loosely connected themes: the rescue of the helpless poor from
their enemies, God's worldwide judgment and rule over the nations, the
psalmist's own concern for rescue (
â‡’
 Psalm 9:14-15).

 [15] Daughter Zion: an ancient Near
Eastern city could sometimes be personified as a woman or a queen, the spouse
of the god of the city.

 [17] The Lord is revealed in this
divine rule: God has so made the universe that the wicked are punished by the
very actions they perform.
