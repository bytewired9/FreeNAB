[2]
 The LORD is king, robed
with majesty; the LORD is robed, girded with might. The world will surely stand
in place, never to be moved. 
2
Your throne stands firm from of old; you are
from everlasting, LORD.

[3]
 The flood has raised up, LORD; the flood has
raised up its roar; the flood has raised its pounding waves. 
4
More powerful than the roar of many waters,
more powerful than the breakers of the sea, powerful in the heavens is the
LORD. 
5
Your decrees are firmly established; holiness
belongs to your house, LORD, for all the length of days.

 [Psalm 93] A hymn celebrating the
kingship of God, who created the world (
⇒
 Psalm
93:1-2) by defeating the sea (
⇒
 Psalm
93:3-4). In the ancient myth that is alluded to here, Sea completely
covered the land, making it impossible for the human community to live. Sea, or
Flood, roars in anger against God, who is personified in the storm. God's
utterances or decrees are given authority by the victory over Sea
(
⇒
 Psalm 93:5).

 [1] The LORD is king: literally,
"the LORD reigns." This psalm, and Psalms 47; 96-99, are sometimes
called enthronement psalms. They may have been used in a special liturgy during
which God's ascent to the throne was ritually reenacted. They have also been
interpreted eschatologically, pointing to the coming of God as king at the
end-time.

 [3] The flood: the primordial sea
was tamed by God in the act of creation. It is a figure of chaos and rebellion.
