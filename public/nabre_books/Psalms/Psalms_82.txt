A psalm of Asaph. 
[1]
 God
rises in the divine council, gives judgment in the midst of the gods. 
2
"How long will you judge unjustly and
favor the cause of the wicked? Selah 
3
Defend the lowly and fatherless; render justice
to the afflicted and needy. 
4
Rescue the lowly and poor; deliver them from
the hand of the wicked." 
5
[2]
 The gods neither know nor understand,
wandering about in darkness, and all the world's foundations shake. 
6
[3]
 I declare: "Gods though you be, offspring
of the Most High all of you, 
7
Yet like any mortal you shall die; like any
prince you shall fall." 
8
[4]
 Arise, O God, judge the earth, for yours are
all the nations.

 [Psalm 82] As in Psalm 58, the
pagan gods are seen as subordinate divine beings to whom Israel's God had
delegated oversight of the foreign countries in the beginning
(
⇒
 Deut 32:8-9). Now God arises in the heavenly
assembly (
⇒
 Psalm 82:1) to rebuke the unjust
"gods" (
⇒
 Psalm 82:2-4), who are stripped
of divine status and reduced in rank to mortals (
⇒
 Psalm
82:5-7). They are accused of misruling the earth by not upholding the
poor. A short prayer for universal justice concludes the psalm
(
⇒
 Psalm 82:8). 
2
 [5] The gods are blind and unable
to declare what is right. Their misrule shakes earth's foundations (cf
⇒
 Psalm 11:3; 
⇒
 75:4),
which God made firm in creation (
⇒
 Psalm 96:10).
3
 [6] I declare: "Gods though
you be": in 
⇒
 John 10:34 Jesus uses the verse
to prove that those to whom the word of God is addressed can fittingly be
called "gods."
4
 [8] Judge the earth: according to
⇒
 Deut 32:8-9, Israel's God had originally assigned
jurisdiction over the foreign nations to the subordinate deities, keeping
Israel as a personal possession. Now God will directly take over the rulership
of the whole world.
