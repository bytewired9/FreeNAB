 For the leader. A psalm of David. 
2
O God, whom I praise, do not be silent, for
wicked and treacherous mouths attack me. They speak against me with lying
tongues; 
3
with hateful words they surround me, attacking
me without cause. 
4
In return for my love they slander me, even
though I prayed for them. 
5
They repay me evil for good, hatred for my
love. My enemies say of me: 
6
[2]
 "Find a lying witness, an accuser to
stand by his right hand, 
7
That he may be judged and found guilty, that
his plea may be in vain. 
8
May his days be few; may another take his
office. 
9
May his children be fatherless, his wife, a
widow. 
10
May his children be vagrant beggars, driven
from their hovels. 
11
May the usurer snare all he owns, strangers
plunder all he earns. 
12
May no one treat him kindly or pity his
fatherless children. 
13
May his posterity be destroyed, his name cease
in the next generation. 
14
May the LORD remember his fathers' guilt; his
mother's sin not be canceled. 
15
May their guilt be always before the LORD, till
their memory is banished from the earth, 
16
For he did not remember to show kindness, but
hounded the wretched poor and brought death to the brokenhearted. 
17
He loved cursing; may it come upon him; he
hated blessing; may none come to him. 
18
May cursing clothe him like a robe; may it
enter his belly like water, seep into his bones like oil. 
19
May it be near as the clothes he wears, as the
belt always around him." 
20
[3]
 May the LORD bring all this upon my accusers,
upon those who speak evil against me. 
21
But you, LORD, my God, deal kindly with me for
your name's sake; in your great mercy rescue me. 
22
For I am sorely in need; my heart is pierced
within me. 
23
Like a lengthening shadow I near my end, all
but swept away like the locust. 
24
My knees totter from fasting; my flesh has
wasted away. 
25
I have become a mockery to them; when they see
me, they shake their heads. 
26
Help me, LORD, my God; save me in your
kindness. 
27
Make them know this is your hand, that you,
LORD, have acted. 
28
Though they curse, may you bless; shame my
foes, that your servant may rejoice. 
29
Clothe my accusers with disgrace; make them
wear shame like a mantle. 
30
I will give fervent thanks to the LORD; before
all I will praise my God. 
31
For God stands at the right hand of the poor to
defend them against unjust accusers.

 [Psalm 109] A lament notable for the
length and vehemence of its prayer against evildoers (
⇒
 Psalm
109:6-20); the cry to God (
⇒
 Psalm 109:1)
and the complaint (
⇒
 Psalm 109:22-25) are brief in
comparison. The psalmist is apparently the victim of a slander campaign,
potentially devastating in a society where reputation and honor are paramount.
In the emotional perspective of the psalm, there are only two types of people:
the wicked and their poor victims. The psalmist is a poor victim
(Psalm 108:22,
31) and by that fact a friend of God and enemy
of the wicked. The psalmist seeks vindication not on the basis of personal
virtue but because of God's promise to protect the poor.

 [6] An accuser: Hebrew satan, a
word occurring in Job 1-2 and 
⇒
 Zechariah 3:1-2. In
the latter passage Satan stands at the right hand of the high priest to bring
false accusations against him before God. Here the accuser is human.
3
 [20] May the LORD bring all this:
the psalmist prays that God ratify the curses of 6-19 and bring them upon the
wicked.
