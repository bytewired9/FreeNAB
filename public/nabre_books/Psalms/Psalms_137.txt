[1]
 By the rivers of Babylon we sat mourning and
weeping when we remembered Zion. 
2
[2]
 On the poplars of that land we hung up our
harps. 
3
There our captors asked us for the words of a
song; Our tormentors, for a joyful song: "Sing for us a song of
Zion!" 
4
But how could we sing a song of the LORD in a
foreign land? 
5
If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand
wither. 
6
May my tongue stick to my palate if I do not
remember you, If I do not exalt Jerusalem beyond all my delights. 
7
Remember, LORD, against Edom that day at
Jerusalem. They said: "Level it, level it down to its foundations!" 
8
Fair Babylon, you destroyer, happy those who
pay you back the evil you have done us! 
9
[3]
 Happy those who seize your children and smash
them against a rock.

 [Psalm 137] A temple singer refuses
to sing the people's sacred songs in an alien land despite demands from Babylonian
captors (
⇒
 Psalm 137:1-4). The singer swears an
oath by what is most dear to a musician - hands and tongue - to exalt Jerusalem
always (
⇒
 Psalm 137:5-6). The psalm ends with a
prayer that the old enemies of Jerusalem, Edom and Babylon, be destroyed
(
⇒
 Psalm 137:7-9).

 [2] Poplars: sometimes incorrectly
translated "willow." The Euphrates poplar is a high tree common on
riverbanks in the Orient.

 [9] Happy those who seize your
children and smash them against a rock: the infants represent the future
generations, and so must be destroyed if the enemy is truly to be eradicated.
