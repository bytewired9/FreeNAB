A song of ascents. 
[1]
 Like Mount
Zion are they who trust in the LORD, unshakable, forever enduring. 
2
As mountains surround Jerusalem, the LORD
surrounds his people both now and forever. 
3
[2]
 The scepter of the wicked will not prevail in
the land given to the just, Lest the just themselves turn their hands to evil. 
4
Do good, LORD, to the good, to those who are
upright of heart. 
5
But those who turn aside to crooked ways may
the LORD send down with the wicked. Peace upon Israel!

 [Psalm 125] In response to exilic
anxieties about the ancient promises of restoration, the psalm expresses
confidence that God will surround the people as the mountains surround Zion
(
⇒
 Psalm 125:1-2). The just will not be
contaminated by the wicked (
⇒
 Psalm 125:3). May God
judge between the two groups (
⇒
 Psalm 125:4-5).

 [3] The land given to the just:
literally, "the lot of the just." The promised land was divided among
the tribes of Israel by lot (
⇒
 Numbers 26:55; Joshua
18). The just are the members of the people who are obedient to God. If the
domination of the wicked were to continue in the land, even the just would be
infected by their evil attitudes.
