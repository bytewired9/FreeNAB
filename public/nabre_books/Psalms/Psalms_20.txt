 For the leader. A psalm of David. 
2
The LORD answer you in time of distress; the
name of the God of Jacob defend you! 
3
May God send you help from the temple, from
Zion be your support. 
4
[2]
 May God remember your every offering,
graciously accept your holocaust, Selah 
5
Grant what is in your heart, fulfill your every
plan. 
6
[3]
 May we shout for joy at your victory, raise
the banners in the name of our God. The LORD grant your every prayer! 
7
Now I know victory is given to the anointed of
the LORD. God will answer him from the holy heavens with a strong arm that
brings victory. 
8
Some rely on chariots, others on horses, but we
on the name of the LORD our God. 
9
They collapse and fall, but we stand strong and
firm. 
10
LORD, grant victory to the king; answer when we
call upon you.

 [Psalm 20] The people pray for the
king before battle. The people ask for divine help (
⇒
 Psalm
20:2-6) and express confidence that such help will be given
(
⇒
 Psalm 20:7-10). A solemn assurance of divine help
may well have been given between the two sections in the liturgy, something
like the promises of 
⇒
 Psalm 12:6;
⇒
 21:9-13. The final verse (
⇒
 Psalm
20:9) [10] echoes the opening verse.

 [4] Remember: God's remembering
implies readiness to act. Cf 
⇒
 Genesis 8:1;
⇒
 Exodus 2:24

 [6] Victory: the Hebrew root is
often translated "salvation," "to save," but in military
contexts it can have the specific meaning of "victory."
