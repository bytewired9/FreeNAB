 For the leader. Do not destroy! A psalm of
Asaph; a song. 
2
[2]
 We thank you, God, we give thanks; we call
upon your name, declare your wonderful deeds. You said: 
3
"I will choose the time; I will judge
fairly. 
4
The earth and all its inhabitants will quake,
but I have firmly set its pillars." Selah 
5
[3]
 So I say to the boastful: "Do not
boast!" to the wicked: "Do not raise your horns! 
6
Do not raise your horns against heaven! Do not
speak arrogantly against the Rock!" 
7
For judgment comes not from east or from west,
not from the desert or from the mountains, 
8
But from God who decides, who brings some low
and raises others high. 
9
[4]
 Yes, a cup is in the LORD'S hand, foaming
wine, fully spiced. When God pours it out, they will drain it even to the
dregs; all the wicked of the earth must drink. 
10
But I will rejoice forever; I will sing praise
to the God of Jacob, 
11
Who has said: "I will break off all the
horns of the wicked, but the horns of the just shall be lifted up."

thanks and rejoices (
⇒
 Psalm 75:2,
⇒
 10) for the direct intervention of God, which is
promised in two oracles (3-4,11). Expecting that divine intervention, the
psalmist warns evildoers to repent (
⇒
 Psalm 75:5-9).

 [2] You said: supplied for clarity
here and in 
⇒
 Psalm 75:11. The translation assumes
in both places that the psalmist is citing an oracle of God.
3
 [5] Do not raise your horns!: the
horn is the symbol of strength; to raise one's horn is to exalt one's own power
as 
⇒
 Psalm 75:5 explains.

A cup: "the
cup of God's wrath" is the punishment inflicted on the wicked. Cf
⇒
 Isaiah 51:17; 
⇒
 Jeremiah
25:15-29;

 49:12;
⇒
 Ezekiel 23:31-33. Spiced: literally, "a
mixed drink"; spices or drugs were added to wine. Cf
⇒
 Proverb 9:2, 5.
