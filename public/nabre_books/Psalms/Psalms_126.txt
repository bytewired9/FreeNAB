A song of ascents. 
[1]
 When
the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, then we thought we were dreaming. 
2
Our mouths were filled with laughter; our
tongues sang for joy. Then it was said among the nations, "The LORD had
done great things for them." 
3
The LORD has done great things for us; Oh, how
happy we were! 
4
[2]
 Restore again our fortunes, LORD, like the dry
stream beds of the Negeb. 
5
Those who sow in tears will reap with cries of
joy. 
6
Those who go forth weeping, carrying sacks of
seed, Will return with cries of joy, carrying their bundled sheaves.

 [Psalm 126] A lament probably sung
shortly after Israel's return from exile. The people rejoice that they are in
Zion (
⇒
 Psalm 126:1-3) but mere presence in the
holy city is not enough; they must pray for the prosperity and the fertility of
the land (
⇒
 Psalm 126:4). The last verses are
probably an oracle of promise: the painful work of sowing will be crowned with
life (
⇒
 Psalm 126:5-6).

 [4] Like the dry stream beds of the
Negeb: the psalmist prays for rain in such abundance that the dry riverbeds
will run.
