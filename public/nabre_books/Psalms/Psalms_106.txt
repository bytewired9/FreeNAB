 Hallelujah! Give thanks to the LORD, who is
good, whose love endures forever. 
2
Who can tell the mighty deeds of the LORD,
proclaim in full God's praise? 
3
Happy those who do what is right, whose deeds
are always just. 
4
Remember me, LORD, as you favor your people;
come to me with your saving help, 
5
That I may see the prosperity of your chosen,
rejoice in the joy of your people, and glory with your heritage. 
6
We have sinned like our ancestors; we have done
wrong and are guilty. 
7
Our ancestors in Egypt did not attend to your
wonders. They did not remember your great love; they defied the Most High at
the Red Sea. 
8
Yet he saved them for his name's sake to make
his power known. 
9
He roared at the Red Sea and it dried up. He
led them through the deep as through a desert. 
10
He rescued them from hostile hands, freed them
from the power of the enemy. 
11
The waters covered their oppressors; not one of
them survived. 
12
Then they believed his words and sang songs of
praise. 
13
But they soon forgot all he had done; they had
no patience for his plan. 
14
In the desert they gave way to their cravings,
tempted God in the wasteland. 
15
So he gave them what they asked and sent among
them a wasting disease. 
16
In the camp they challenged Moses and Aaron,
the holy one of the LORD. 
17
The earth opened and swallowed Dathan, it
closed on the followers of Abiram. 
18
Against that company the fire blazed; flames
consumed the wicked. 
19
At Horeb they fashioned a calf, worshiped a
metal statue. 
20
They exchanged their glorious God for the image
of a grass-eating bull. 
21
They forgot the God who saved them, who did
great deeds in Egypt, 
22
Amazing deeds in the land of Ham, fearsome
deeds at the Red Sea. 
23
[2]
 He would have decreed their destruction, had not
Moses, the chosen leader, Withstood him in the breach to turn back his
destroying anger. 
24
Next they despised the beautiful land; they did
not believe the promise. 
25
In their tents they complained; they did not obey
the LORD. 
26
So with raised hand he swore to destroy them in
the desert, 
27
To scatter their descendants among the nations,
disperse them in foreign lands. 
28
They joined in the rites of Baal of Peor, ate
food sacrificed to dead gods. 
29
They provoked him by their actions, and a
plague broke out among them. 
30
Then Phinehas rose to intervene, and the plague
was brought to a halt. 
31
This was counted for him as a righteous deed
for all generations to come. 
32
[3]
 At the waters of Meribah they angered God, and
Moses suffered because of them. 
33
They so embittered his spirit that rash words
crossed his lips. 
34
They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD
had commanded them, 
35
But mingled with the nations and imitated their
ways. 
36
They worshiped their idols and were ensnared by
them. 
37
[4]
 They sacrificed to the gods their own sons and
daughters, 
38
Shedding innocent blood, the blood of their own
sons and daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, desecrating
the land with bloodshed. 
39
They defiled themselves by their actions,
became adulterers by their conduct. 
40
So the LORD grew angry with his people,
abhorred his own heritage. 
41
He handed them over to the nations, and their
adversaries ruled them. 
42
Their enemies oppressed them, kept them under
subjection. 
43
Many times did he rescue them, but they kept
rebelling and scheming and were brought low by their own guilt. 
44
Still God had regard for their affliction when
he heard their wailing. 
45
For their sake he remembered his covenant and
relented in his abundant love, 
46
Winning for them compassion from all who held
them captive. 
47
Save us, LORD, our God; gather us from among
the nations That we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in praising
you. 
48
[5]
 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from
everlasting to everlasting! Let all the people say, Amen! Hallelujah!

 [Psalm 106] Israel is invited to
praise the God whose mercy has always tempered judgment of Israel (
⇒
 Psalm
106:1-3). The speaker, on behalf of all, seeks solidarity with the
people, who can always count on God's fidelity despite their sin
(
⇒
 Psalm 106:4-5). Confident of God's mercy, the
speaker invites national repentance (
⇒
 Psalm 106:6)
by reciting from Israel's history eight instances of sin, judgment, and
forgiveness. The sins are the rebellion at the Red Sea
(
⇒
 Psalm 106:6-12; see Exodus 14-15), the craving
for meat in the desert (
⇒
 Psalm 106:13-15; see
Numbers 11), the challenge to Moses' authority (
⇒
 Psalm
106:16-18; see Numbers 16), the golden calf episode
(
⇒
 Psalm 106:19-23; see Exodus 32-34), the refusal
to take Canaan by the southern route (
⇒
 Psalm
106:24-27; see Numbers 13-14 and Deut 1-2), the rebellion at
Baal-Peor (
⇒
 Psalm 106:28-31; see 
⇒
 Numbers
25:1-10), the anger of Moses (
⇒
 Psalm
106:32-33; see 
⇒
 Numbers 20:1-13), and
mingling with the nations (
⇒
 Psalm 106:34-47). The
last, as suggested by its length and generalized language, may be the sin that
invites the repentance of the present generation. The text gives the site of
each sin: Egypt (
⇒
 Psalm 106:7), the desert
(
⇒
 Psalm 106:14), the camp
(
⇒
 Psalm 106:16), Horeb
(
⇒
 Psalm 106:19), in their tents
(
⇒
 Psalm 106:25), Baal-Peor
(
⇒
 Psalm 106:28), the waters of Meribah (
⇒
 Psalm
106:32), Canaan (
⇒
 Psalm 106:38).

 [23] Withstood him in the breach:
the image is that of Moses standing in a narrow break made in the wall to keep
anyone from entering.
3
 [32] Moses suffered because of
them: Moses was not allowed to enter the promised land because of his rash
words (
⇒
 Numbers 20:12). According to
⇒
 Deut 1:37, Moses was not allowed to cross because of
the people's sin, not his own.

 [37] The gods: Hebrew shedim,
customarily translated "demons," occurs in parallelism with
"gods" in an important inscription from Transjordan and hence is
translated "gods."
