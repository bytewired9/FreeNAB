Of David. 
[1]
 Bless the LORD,
my soul; all my being, bless his holy name! 
2
Bless the LORD, my soul; do not forget all the
gifts of God, 
3
Who pardons all your sins, heals all your ills,
4
Delivers your life from the pit, surrounds you
with love and compassion, 
5
[2]
 Fills your days with good things; your youth
is renewed like the eagle's. 
6
The LORD does righteous deeds, brings justice
to all the oppressed. 
7
His ways were revealed to Moses, mighty deeds
to the people of Israel. 
8
Merciful and gracious is the LORD, slow to
anger, abounding in kindness. 
9
God does not always rebuke, nurses no lasting
anger, 
10
Has not dealt with us as our sins merit, nor
requited us as our deeds deserve. 
11
As the heavens tower over the earth, so God's
love towers over the faithful. 
12
As far as the east is from the west, so far
have our sins been removed from us. 
13
As a father has compassion on his children, so
the LORD has compassion on the faithful. 
14
For he knows how we are formed, remembers that
we are dust. 
15
Our days are like the grass; like flowers of
the field we blossom. 
16
The wind sweeps over us and we are gone; our
place knows us no more. 
17
But the LORD'S kindness is forever, toward the
faithful from age to age. He favors the children's children 
18
of those who keep his covenant, who take care
to fulfill its precepts. 
19
The LORD'S throne is established in heaven;
God's royal power rules over all. 
20
Bless the LORD, all you angels, mighty in
strength and attentive, obedient to every command. 
21
Bless the LORD, all you hosts, ministers who do
God's will. 
22
Bless the LORD, all creatures, everywhere in
God's domain. Bless the LORD, my soul!

 [Psalm 103] The speaker in this
hymn begins by praising God for personal benefits (
⇒
 Psalm
103:1-5), then moves on to God's mercy toward all the people
(
⇒
 Psalm 103:6-18). Even sin cannot destroy that
mercy (
⇒
 Psalm 103:11-13), for the eternal God is
well aware of the people's human fragility (
⇒
 Psalm
103:14-18). The psalmist invites the heavenly beings to join in
praise (
⇒
 Psalm 103:19-22).

 [5] Your youth is renewed like the
eagle's: because of the eagle's long life it was a symbol of perennial youth
and vigor. Cf
