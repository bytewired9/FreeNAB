 For the leader; with
stringed instruments. A psalm of David. 
2
Answer when I call, my saving God. In my
troubles, you cleared a way; show me favor; hear my prayer. 
3
How long will you people mock my honor, love
what is worthless, chase after lies? Selah 
4
Know that the LORD works wonders for the
faithful; the LORD hears when I call out. 
5
[3]
 Tremble and do not sin; upon your beds ponder
in silence. 
6
Offer fitting sacrifice and trust in the LORD. 
7
Many say, "May we see better times! LORD,
show us the light of your face!" Selah 
8
But you have given my heart more joy than they
have when grain and wine abound. 
9
In peace I shall both lie down and sleep, for
you alone, LORD, make me secure.
1
 [Psalm 4] An individual lament
emphasizing trust in God. The petition is based upon the psalmist's vivid
experience of God as savior (
⇒
 Psalm 4:2). That
experience of God is the basis for the warning to the wicked: revere God who
intervenes on the side of the faithful (
⇒
 Psalm
4:3-6). The faithful psalmist exemplifies the blessings given to the
just (
⇒
 Psalm 4:7-8).

 [1] For the leader: many psalm
headings contain this rubric. Its exact meaning is unknown but may signify that
such psalms once stood together in a collection of "the choirmaster."
Cf 
⇒
 1
Chron 15:21. 
3
 [5] Tremble: be moved deeply with
religious awe. The Greek translation understood the emotion to be anger, and it
is so cited in 
⇒
 Eph 4:26.
