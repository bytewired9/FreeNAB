 For the leader. A psalm of David. A song. 
2
[2]
 To you we owe our hymn of praise, O God on
Zion; To you our vows must be fulfilled, 
3
[3]
 you who hear our prayers. To you all flesh
must come 
4
with its burden of wicked deeds. We are
overcome by our sins; only you can pardon them. 
5
Happy the chosen ones you bring to dwell in
your courts. May we be filled with the good things of your house, the blessings
of your holy temple! 
6
[4]
 You answer us with awesome deeds of justice, O
God our savior, The hope of all the ends of the earth and of far distant
islands. 
7
You are robed in power, you set up the
mountains by your might. 
8
You still the roaring of the seas, the roaring
of their waves, the tumult of the peoples. 
9
Distant peoples stand in awe of your marvels;
east and west you make resound with joy. 
10
[5]
[6]
 You visit the earth and
water it, make it abundantly fertile. God's stream is filled with water; with
it you supply the world with grain. Thus do you prepare the earth: 
11
you drench plowed furrows, and level their
ridges. With showers you keep the ground soft, blessing its young sprouts. 
12
[7]
 You adorn the year with your bounty; your
paths drip with fruitful rain. 
13
The untilled meadows also drip; the hills are
robed with joy. 
14
The pastures are clothed with flocks, the
valleys blanketed with grain; they cheer and sing for joy.

 [Psalm 65] The community, aware of
its unworthiness (
⇒
 Psalm 65:3-4), gives thanks for
divine bounty (
⇒
 Psalm 65:5), a bounty resulting
from God's creation victory (
⇒
 Psalm 65:6-9). At
God's touch the earth comes alive with vegetation and flocks
(
⇒
 Psalm 65:10-13). 
2
 [2] Vows: the Israelites were
accustomed to promising sacrifices in the temple if their prayers were heard.
3
 [3] To you all flesh must come: all
must have recourse to God's mercy.
4
 [6] Awesome deeds: the acts of
creating - installing mountains, taming seas, restraining nations
(
⇒
 Psalm 65:7-8) - that are visible worldwide
(
⇒
 Psalm 65:6, 9).
5
 [9-13] Apparently a description of
the agricultural year, beginning with the first fall rains that soften the hard
sun-baked soil (
⇒
 Psalm 65:9-10).
6
 [9] God's stream: the fertile
waters of the earth derive from God's fertile waters in the heavenly world.
7
 [12] Paths: probably the tracks of
God's storm chariot dropping rain upon earth.
