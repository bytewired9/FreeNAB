 For the leader. A psalm of David. 
2
How long, LORD? Will you utterly forget me? How
long will you hide your face from me? 
3
How long must I carry sorrow in my soul, grief
in my heart day after day? How long will my enemy triumph over me? 
4
Look upon me, answer me, LORD, my God! Give
light to my eyes lest I sleep in death, 
5
Lest my enemy say, "I have
prevailed," lest my foes rejoice at my downfall. 
6
I trust in your faithfulness. Grant my heart
joy in your help, That I may sing of the LORD, "How good our God has been
to me!"

 [1] A lament in which the psalmist,
seriously ill (
⇒
 Psalm 13:4), expresses fear that
enemies will interpret his or her death as a divine judgment. Hence the
heartfelt prayer (
⇒
 Psalm 13:2-3) is for healing
that will signal to those enemies that the psalmist enjoys God's favor
(
⇒
 Psalm 13:4-5). The poem ends with a confession of
trust in God and a statement of praise (
⇒
 Psalm
13:6).
