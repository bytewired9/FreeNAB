[1]
 A psalm of David. 
[2]
 The
LORD is my shepherd; there is nothing I lack. 
2
In green pastures you let me graze; to safe
waters you lead me; 
3
[3]
 you restore my strength. You guide me along
the right path for the sake of your name. 
4
[4]
 Even when I walk through a dark valley, I fear
no harm for you are at my side; your rod and staff give me courage. 
5
[5]
 You set a table before me as my enemies watch;
You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 
6
[6]
 Only goodness and love will pursue me all the
days of my life; I will dwell in the house of the LORD for years to come.

 [Psalm 23] God's loving care for
the psalmist is portrayed under the figures of a shepherd for the flock
(
⇒
 Psalm 23:1-4) and a host's generosity toward a
guest (
⇒
 Psalm 23:5-6). The imagery of both sections
is drawn from traditions of the exodus (
⇒
 Isaiah
40:11; 
⇒
 49:10;
⇒
 Jeremiah 31:10).
2
 [1] My shepherd: God as good
shepherd is common in both the Old Testament and the New Testament
(
⇒
 Ezekiel 34:11-16; 
⇒
 John
10:11-18). 
3
 [3] The right path: connotes
"right way" and "way of righteousness."
4
 [4] A dark valley: a different
division of the Hebrew consonants yields the translation "the valley of
the shadow of death."
5
 [5] You set a table before me: this
expression occurs in an exodus context in 
⇒
 Psalm
78:19. As my enemies watch: my enemies see that I am God's friend and
guest. Oil: a perfumed ointment made from olive oil, used especially at
banquets (
⇒
 Psalm 104:15;
⇒
 Matthew 26:7; 
⇒
 Luke
7:37, 
⇒
 46; 
⇒
 John
12:2).

 [6] Goodness and love: the
blessings of God's covenant with Israel.
