 A psalm of David, when he
fled from his son Absalom. 
2
How many are my foes, LORD! How many rise
against me! 
3
[3]
 How many say of me, "God will not save
that one." Selah 
4
But you, LORD, are a shield around me; my
glory, you keep my head high. 
5
Whenever I cried out to the LORD, I was
answered from the holy mountain. Selah 
6
Whenever I lay down and slept, the LORD
preserved me to rise again. 
7
I do not fear, then, thousands of people
arrayed against me on every side. 
8
Arise, LORD! Save me, my God! You will shatter
the jaws of all my foes; you will break the teeth of the wicked. 
9
Safety comes from the LORD! Your blessing for
your people! Selah 
1
 [Psalm 3] An individual lament
complaining of enemies who deny that God will come to the rescue
(
⇒
 Psalm 3:2-3). Despite such taunts the psalmist
hopes for God's protection even in sleep (
⇒
 Psalm
3:4-7). The psalm prays for an end to the enemies' power to speak
maliciously (
⇒
 Psalm 3:8) and closes peacefully with
an expression of trust (
⇒
 Psalm 3:8)[9].
