 A psalm of David. LORD,
who may abide in your tent? Who may dwell on your holy mountain? 
2
IWhoever walks without blame, doing what is
right, speaking truth from the heart; 
3
Who does not slander a neighbor, does no harm
to another, never defames a friend; 
4
Who disdains the wicked, but honors those who
fear the LORD; Who keeps an oath despite the cost,

[3]
 lends no money at interest, accepts no bribe
against the innocent. III Whoever acts like this shall never be shaken.

 [Psalm 15] The psalm records a
liturgical scrutiny at the entrance to the temple court (cf
⇒
 Psalm 24:3-6; 
⇒
 Isaiah
33:14b-16). The Israelite wishing to be admitted had to ask the
temple official what conduct was appropriate to God's precincts. Note the
emphasis on virtues relating to one's neighbor.

 [1] Your tent . . . your holy
mountain: the temple could be referred to as "tent"
(
⇒
 Psalm 61:5; 
⇒
 Isaiah
33:20), a reference to the tent of the wilderness period and the tent
of David (
⇒
 2 Sam 6:17;
⇒
 7:2), predecessors of the temple. Holy mountain: a
venerable designation of the divine abode (
⇒
 Psalm
2:6; 
⇒
 3:5;
⇒
 43:3; 
⇒
 48:2 etc.).

 [5] Lends no money at interest:
lending money in the Old Testament was often seen as assistance to the poor in
their distress, not as an investment; making money off the poor by charging
interest was thus forbidden (
⇒
 Exodus 22:24;
⇒
 Lev 25:36-37; 
⇒
 Deut
23:20).
