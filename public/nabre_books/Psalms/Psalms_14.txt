[1]
 For the leader. Of David. 
[2]
Fools say in their hearts, "There is no God." Their deeds are
loathsome and corrupt; not one does what is right. 
2
The LORD looks down from heaven upon the human
race, To see if even one is wise, if even one seeks God. 
3
All have gone astray; all alike are perverse.
Not one does what is right, not even one. 
4
Will these evildoers never learn? They devour
my people as they devour bread; they do not call upon the LORD. 
5
They have good reason, then, to fear; God is
with the company of the just. 
6
They would crush the hopes of the poor, but the
poor have the LORD as their refuge.

[3]
 Oh, that from Zion might come the deliverance
of Israel, That Jacob may rejoice, and Israel be glad when the LORD restores
his people!

 [Psalm 14] The lament (duplicated
in Psalm 53) depicts the world as consisting of two types of people: "the
fools" (= the wicked, 
⇒
 Psalm 14:1-3) and
"the company of the just" (
⇒
 Psalm 14:4-6;
also called "my people," and "the poor"). The wicked persecute
the just, but the psalm expresses the hope that God will punish the wicked and
reward the good.

 [1] Fools: literally, "the
fool." The singular is used typically, hence the plural translation.

 [7] Israel . . . Jacob . . . his people: the righteous poor are
identified with God's people.
