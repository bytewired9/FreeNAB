[1]
 A miktam of David. 
[2]
 Keep
me safe, O God; in you I take refuge 
2
I say to the Lord, you are my Lord, you are my
only good. 
3
Worthless are all the false gods of the land.
Accursed are all who delight in them. 
4
[3]
 They multiply their sorrows who court other
gods. Blood libations to them I will not pour out, nor will I take their names
upon my lips. 
5
LORD, my allotted portion and my cup, you have
made my destiny secure. 
6
[4]
 Pleasant places were measured out for me; fair
to me indeed is my inheritance. 
7
I bless the LORD who counsels me; even at night
my heart exhorts me. 
8
I keep the LORD always before me; with the Lord
at my right, I shall never be shaken. 
9
Therefore my heart is glad, my soul rejoices;
my body also dwells secure, 
10
[5]
 For you will not abandon me to Sheol, nor let
your faithful servant see the pit. 
11
You will show me the path to life, abounding
joy in your presence, the delights at your right hand forever.

times in psalm superscriptions, always with "David." Its meaning is
unknown.

 [4] Take their names: to use the
gods' names in oaths and hence to affirm them as one's own gods.

 [6] Pleasant places were measured
out for me: the psalmist is pleased with the plot of land measured out to the
family, which was to be passed on to succeeding generations ("my
inheritance").

 [10] Nor let your faithful servant
see the pit: Hebrew shahath means here the pit, a synonym for Sheol, the
underworld. The Greek translation derives the word here and elsewhere from the
verb shahath, "to be corrupt." On the basis of the Greek,
