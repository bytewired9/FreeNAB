 For the leader; according to
"Lilies." A maskil of the Korahites. A love song. 
2
My heart is stirred by a noble theme, as I sing
my ode to the king. My tongue is the pen of a nimble scribe. 
3
You are the most handsome of men; fair speech
has graced your lips, for God has blessed you forever. 
4
Gird your sword upon your hip, mighty warrior!
In splendor and majesty ride on triumphant! 
5
In the cause of truth and justice may your
right hand show you wondrous deeds. 
6
Your arrows are sharp; peoples will cower at
your feet; the king's enemies will lose heart. 
7
[2]
 Your throne, O god, stands forever; your royal
scepter is a scepter for justice. 
8
You love justice and hate wrongdoing; therefore
God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellow
kings. 
9
[3]
 With myrrh, aloes, and cassia your robes are
fragrant. From ivory-paneled palaces stringed instruments bring you joy. 
10
[4]
 Daughters of kings are your lovely wives; a princess
arrayed in Ophir's gold comes to stand at your right hand. 
11
[5]
 Listen, my daughter, and understand; pay me
careful heed. Forget your people and your father's house, 
12
that the king might desire your beauty. He is
your lord; 
13
honor him, daughter of Tyre. Then the richest
of the people will seek your favor with gifts. 
14
All glorious is the king's daughter as she
enters, her raiment threaded with gold; 
15
In embroidered apparel she is led to the king.
The maids of her train are presented to the king. 
16
They are led in with glad and joyous acclaim;
they enter the palace of the king. 
17
The throne of your fathers your sons will have;
you shall make them princes through all the land. 
18
I will make your name renowned through all
generations; thus nations shall praise you forever.

 [Psalm 45] A song for the Davidic
king's marriage to a foreign princess from Tyre in Phoenicia. The court poet
sings (
⇒
 Psalm 45:2,
⇒
 18) of God's choice of the king
(
⇒
 Psalm 45:3, 8), of
his role in establishing divine rule (
⇒
 Psalm
45:4-8), and of his splendor as he waits for his bride
(
⇒
 Psalm 45:9-10). The woman is to forget her own
house when she becomes wife to the king (
⇒
 Psalm
45:11-13). Her majestic beauty today is a sign of the future
prosperity of the royal house (
⇒
 Psalm 45:14-17).
The psalm was retained in the collection when there was no reigning king, and
came to be applied to the king who was to come, the messiah.

 [7] O god: the king, in courtly
language, is called "god," i.e., more than human, representing God to
the people. 
⇒
 Hebrews 1:8-9 applies
⇒
 Psalm 45:7-8 to Christ.

 [9] Ivory-paneled palaces:
literally, "palaces of ivory." Ivory paneling and furniture
decoration have been found in Samaria and other ancient Near Eastern cities. Cf
⇒
 Amos 3:15.
4
 [10] Ophir's gold: uncertain
location, possibly a region on the coast of southern Arabia or eastern Africa,
famous for its gold. Cf 
⇒
 1 Kings 9:28;
⇒
 10:11; 
⇒
 Job 22:24.

 [11] Forget your people and your
father's house: the bride should no longer consider herself a daughter of her
father's house, but the wife of the king - the queen.
