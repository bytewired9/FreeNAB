[1]
 A psalm of David. LORD, hear my prayer; in
your faithfulness listen to my pleading; answer me in your justice. 
2
Do not enter into judgment with your servant;
before you no living being can be just. 
3
[2]
 The enemy has pursued me; they have crushed my
life to the ground. They have left me in darkness like those long dead. 
4
My spirit is faint within me; my heart is
dismayed. 
5
I remember the days of old; I ponder all your
deeds; the works of your hands I recall. 
6
I stretch out my hands to you; I thirst for you
like a parched land. Selah 
7
Hasten to answer me, LORD; for my spirit fails
me. Do not hide your face from me, lest I become like those descending to the
pit. 
8
At dawn let me hear of your kindness, for in
you I trust. Show me the path I should walk, for to you I entrust my life. 
9
Rescue me, LORD, from my foes, for in you I
hope. 
10
Teach me to do your will, for you are my God.
May your kind spirit guide me on ground that is level. 
11
For your name's sake, LORD, give me life; in
your justice lead me out of distress. 
12
In your kindness put an end to my foes; destroy
all who attack me, for I am your servant. Psalm

 [Psalm 143] One of the Church's
seven Penitential Psalms, this lament is a prayer to be freed from
death-dealing enemies. The psalmist addresses God, aware that there is no
equality between God and humans; salvation is a gift (
⇒
 Psalm
143:1-2). Victimized by evil people (
⇒
 Psalm 143:3-4),
the psalmist recites ("remembers") God's past actions on behalf of
the innocent (
⇒
 Psalm 143:5-6). The psalm continues
with fervent prayer (
⇒
 Psalm 143:7-9) and a strong
desire for guidance and protection (
⇒
 Psalm
143:10-12).

 [Psalm 144] They have crushed:
literally, "he crushed"; the singular is used typically, hence the
plural translation.
