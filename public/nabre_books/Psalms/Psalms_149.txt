[1]
 Hallelujah! Sing to the LORD a new song, a
hymn in the assembly of the faithful. 
2
Let Israel be glad in their maker, the people
of Zion rejoice in their king. 
3
[2]
 Let them praise his name in festive dance,
make music with tambourine and lyre. 
4
For the LORD takes delight in his people,
honors the poor with victory. 
5
[3]
 Let the faithful rejoice in their glory, cry
out for joy at their banquet, 
6
With the praise of God in their mouths, and a
two-edged sword in their hands, 
7
To bring retribution on the nations, punishment
on the peoples, 
8
To bind their kings with chains, shackle their
nobles with irons, 
9
[4]
 To execute the judgments decreed for them
-  such is the glory of all God's
faithful. Hallelujah!

because God has chosen them and given them victory (

people must be ready to do again those acts in the future at the divine command
(

 [3] Make music with tambourine and
lyre: the verse recalls the great exodus hymn of

 [5] At their banquet: literally,
"upon their couches." The people reclined to banquet.

 [9] The glory: what brings honor to
the people is their readiness to carry out the divine will, here conceived as
punishing injustice done by the nations.
