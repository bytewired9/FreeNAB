[1]
 A psalm. A sabbath song. 
2
It is good to give thanks to the LORD, to sing praise
to your name, Most High, 
3
To proclaim your love in the morning, your
faithfulness in the night, 
4
With the ten-stringed harp, with melody upon
the lyre. 
5
For you make me jubilant, LORD, by your deeds;
at the works of your hands I shout for joy. 
6
How great are your works, LORD! How profound
your purpose! 
7
A senseless person cannot know this; a fool
cannot comprehend. 
8
Though the wicked flourish like grass and all
sinners thrive, They are destined for eternal destruction; 
9
for you, LORD, are forever on high. 
10
Indeed your enemies, LORD, indeed your enemies
shall perish; all sinners shall be scattered. 
11
You have given me the strength of a wild bull;
you have poured rich oil upon me. 
12
My eyes look with glee on my wicked enemies; my
ears delight in the fall of my foes. 
13
The just shall flourish like the palm tree,
shall grow like a cedar of Lebanon. 
14
[2]
 Planted in the house of the LORD, they shall
flourish in the courts of our God. 
15
They shall bear fruit even in old age, always
vigorous and sturdy, 
16
As they proclaim: "The LORD is just; our
rock, in whom there is no wrong."

 [Psalm 92] A hymn of praise and
thanks for God's faithful deeds (
⇒
 Psalm 92:2-5).
The wicked, deluded by their prosperity (
⇒
 Psalm
92:6-9), are punished (
⇒
 Psalm 92:10),
whereas the psalmist has already experienced God's protection
(
⇒
 Psalm 92:11-15).

 [14] Planted: the just are likened
to trees growing in the sacred precincts of the temple, which is often seen as the
source of life and fertility because of God's presence. Cf
