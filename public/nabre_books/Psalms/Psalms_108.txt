 A song; a psalm of David 
2
My heart is steadfast, God; my heart is
steadfast. I will sing and chant praise. 
3
Awake, my soul; awake, lyre and harp! I will
wake the dawn. 
4
I will praise you among the peoples, LORD; I
will chant your praise among the nations. 
5
For your love towers to the heavens; your
faithfulness, to the skies. 
6
Appear on high over the heavens, God; may your
glory appear above all the earth. 
7
Help with your right hand and answer us that
your loved ones may escape. 
8
God promised in the sanctuary: "I will
exult, I will apportion Shechem; the valley of Succoth I will measure out. 
9
Gilead is mine, mine is Manasseh; Ephraim is
the helmet for my head, Judah, my own scepter. 
10
Moab is my washbowl; upon Edom I cast my
sandal; I will triumph over Philistia." 
11
Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who
will lead me into Edom? 
12
Was it not you who rejected us, God? Do you no
longer march with our armies? 
13
Give us aid against the foe; worthless is human
help. 
14
We will triumph with the help of God, who will
trample down our foes.

 [Psalm 108] A prayer compiled from
two other psalms: 
⇒
 Psalm 108:2-6 are virtually the
same as 
⇒
 Psalm 57:8-12; 
⇒
 Psalm
108:7-14 are the same as 
⇒
 Psalm 60:7-14.
An old promise of salvation (
⇒
 Psalm 108:8-10) is
combined with a confident assurance (
⇒
 Psalm 108:2-6,
⇒
 13) and petition (
⇒
 Psalm
108:7, 
⇒
 12-13).
