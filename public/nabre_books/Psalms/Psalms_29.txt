[1]
 A psalm of David. 
[2]
 Give to
the LORD, you heavenly beings, give to the LORD glory and might; 
2
Give to the LORD the glory due God's name. Bow
down before the LORD'S holy splendor! 
3
[3]
 The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the
God of glory thunders, the LORD, over the mighty waters. 
4
The voice of the LORD is power; the voice of
the LORD is splendor. 
5
The voice of the LORD cracks the cedars; the
LORD splinters the cedars of Lebanon, 
6
[4]
 Makes Lebanon leap like a calf, and Sirion
like a young bull. 
7
The voice of the LORD strikes with fiery flame;
8
[5]
 the voice of the LORD rocks the desert; the
LORD rocks the desert of Kadesh. 
9
[6]
 The voice of the LORD twists the oaks and
strips the forests bare. All in his palace say, "Glory!" 
10
[7]
 The LORD sits enthroned above the flood! The
LORD reigns as king forever! 
11
[8]
 May the LORD give might to his people; may the
LORD bless his people with peace!

 [Psalm 29] The hymn invites the
members of the heavenly court to acknowledge God's supremacy by ascribing glory
and might to God alone (
⇒
 Psalm 29:1-2a,
⇒
 9b). Divine glory and might are dramatically
visible in the storm (
⇒
 Psalm 29:3-9a). The storm
apparently comes from the Mediterranean onto the coast of Syria-Palestine and
then moves inland. In 
⇒
 Psalm 29:10 the divine
beings acclaim God's eternal kingship. The psalm concludes with a prayer that
God will impart the power just displayed to the Israelite king and through the
king to Israel.
2
 [1] You heavenly beings: literally
"sons of God," i.e., members of the heavenly court who served
Israel's God in a variety of capacities. 
3
 [3] The voice of the LORD: the
sevenfold repetition of the phrase imitates the sound of crashing thunder and
may allude to God's primordial slaying of Leviathan, the seven-headed sea
monster of Canaanite mythology.
4
 [6] Sirion: the Phoenician name for
Mount Hermon. Cf
⇒
 Deut 3:9.
5
 [8] The desert of Kadesh: probably
north of Palestine in the neighborhood of Lebanon and Hermon.
6
 [9b-10] Having witnessed God's
supreme power (
⇒
 Psalm 29:3-9a), the gods
acknowledge the glory that befits the king of the divine and human world.
7
 [10] The flood: God defeated the
primordial waters and made them part of the universe. Cf
⇒
 Psalm 89:10-13;
⇒
 93:3-4.
8
 [11] His people: God's people,
Israel.
