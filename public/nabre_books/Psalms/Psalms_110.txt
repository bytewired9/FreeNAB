[1]
 A psalm of David. 
[2]
 The
LORD says to you, my lord: "Take your throne at my righthand, while I make
your enemies your footstool." 
2
The scepter of your sovereign might the LORD
will extend from Zion. The LORD says: "Rule over your enemies! 
3
[3]
 Yours is princely power from the day of your
birth. In holy splendor before the daystar, like the dew I begot you." 
4
[4]
 The LORD has sworn and will not waver:
"Like Melchizedek you are a priest forever." 
5
At your right hand is the Lord, who crushes
kings on the day of wrath, 
6
Who, robed in splendor, judges nations, crushes
heads across the wide earth, 
7
[5]
 Who drinks from the brook by the wayside and
thus holds high the head.

 [Psalm 110] A royal psalm in which
a court singer recites three oracles in which God assures the king that his
enemies are conquered (
⇒
 Psalm 110:1-2), makes the
king "son" in traditional adoption language
(
⇒
 Psalm 110:3), gives priestly status to the king
and promises to be with him in future military ventures
(
⇒
 Psalm 110:4-7).

 [1] The LORD says to you, my lord:
literally, "The LORD says to my lord," a polite form of address of an
inferior to a superior. Cf
⇒
 1 Sam 25:25; 
⇒
 2 Sam
1:10. The
court singer refers to the king. Jesus in the synoptic gospels
(
⇒
 Matthew 22:41-46 and parallels) takes the
psalmist to be David and hence "my lord" refers to the messiah, who
must be someone greater than David. Your footstool: in ancient times victorious
kings put their feet on the prostrate bodies of their enemies. 
3
 [3] Like the dew I begot you: an
adoption formula as in 
⇒
 Psalm 2:7;
⇒
 89:27-28. Before the daystar: possibly an
expression for before the world began (
⇒
 Proverb
8:22).
4
 [4] Like Melchizedek: Melchizedek
was the ancient king of Salem (Jerusalem) who blessed Abraham
(
⇒
 Genesis 14:18-20); like other kings of the time
he performed priestly functions. Hebrews 7 sees in Melchizedek a type of
Christ.
5
 [7] Who drinks from the brook by
the wayside: the meaning is uncertain. Some see an allusion to a rite of royal
consecration at the Gihon spring (cf 
⇒
 1 Kings
1:33, 
⇒
 38). Others find here an image of
the divine warrior (or king) pursuing enemies so relentlessly that he does not
stop long enough to eat and drink.
