[2]
 A psalm. A song for the
dedication of the temple. Of David. 
2
I praise you, LORD, for you raised me up and
did not let my enemies rejoice over me. 
3
[3]
 O LORD, my God, I cried out to you and you
healed me. 
4
[4]
 LORD, you brought me up from Sheol; you kept
me from going down to the pit. 
5
Sing praise to the LORD, you faithful; give
thanks to God's holy name. 
6
For divine anger lasts but a moment; divine
favor lasts a lifetime. At dusk weeping comes for the night; but at dawn there
is rejoicing. 
7
[5]
 Complacent, I once said, "I shall never
be shaken." 
8
LORD, when you showed me favor I stood like the
mighty mountains. But when you hid your face I was struck with terror. 
9
To you, LORD, I cried out; with the Lord I
pleaded for mercy: 
10
[6]
 "What gain is there from my lifeblood,
from my going down to the grave? Does dust give you thanks or declare your
faithfulness? 
11
Hear, O LORD, have mercy on me; LORD, be my
helper." 
12
You changed my mourning into dancing; you took
off my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness. 
13
With my whole being I sing endless praise to
you. O LORD, my God, forever will I give you thanks.

 [Psalm 30] An individual
thanksgiving in four parts: praise and thanks for deliverance and restoration
(
⇒
 Psalm 30:2-4); an invitation to others to join in
(
⇒
 Psalm 30:5-6); a flashback to the time before
deliverance (
⇒
 Psalm 30:7-11); a return to praise
and thanks (
⇒
 Psalm 30:12). Two sets of images
recur: 1) going down, death, silence; 2) coming up, life, praising. God has
delivered the psalmist from one state to the other.

 [1] For the dedication of the
temple: a later adaptation of the psalm to celebrate the purification of the
temple in 164 B.C. during the Maccabean Revolt.
