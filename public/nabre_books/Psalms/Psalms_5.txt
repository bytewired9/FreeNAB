[1]
 For the leader; with wind instruments. A psalm
of David. 
2
Hear my words, O LORD; listen to my sighing. 
3
Hear my cry for help, my king, my God! To you I
pray, O LORD; 
4
at dawn you will hear my cry; at dawn I will
plead before you and wait. 
5
You are not a god who delights in evil; no
wicked person finds refuge with you; 
6
the arrogant cannot stand before you. You hate
all who do evil; 
7
you destroy all who speak falsely. Murderers
and deceivers the LORD abhors. 
8
But I can enter your house because of your
great love. I can worship in your holy temple because of my reverence for you,
LORD. 
9
Guide me in your justice because of my foes;
make straight your way before me. 
10
[2]
 For there is no sincerity in their mouths;
their hearts are corrupt. Their throats are open graves; on their tongues are
subtle lies. 
11
Declare them guilty, God; make them fall by
their own devices. Drive them out for their many sins; they have rebelled
against you. 
12
Then all who take refuge in you will be glad
and forever shout for joy. Protect them that you may be the joy of those who
love your name. 
13
For you, LORD, bless the just; you surround
them with favor like a shield.

 [Psalm 5] A lament contrasting the
security of the house of God (
⇒
 Psalm 5:8-9,
⇒
 12-13) with the danger of the company of evildoers
(
⇒
 Psalm 5:5-7, 
⇒
 10-11).
The psalmist therefore prays that God will hear (
⇒
 Psalm
5:2-4) and grant the protection and joy of the temple.

 [10] Their throats: their speech
brings harm to their hearers (cf 
⇒
 Jeremiah 5:16).
The verse mentions four parts of the body, each a source of evil to the
innocent.
