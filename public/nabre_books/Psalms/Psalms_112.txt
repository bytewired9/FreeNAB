[1]
 Hallelujah! 
[2]
 Happy are
those who fear the LORD, who greatly delight in God's commands. 
2
Their descendants shall be mighty in the land,
generation upright and blessed. 
3
[3]
 Wealth and riches shall be in their homes;
their prosperity shall endure forever. 
4
They shine through the darkness, a light for
the upright; they are gracious, merciful, and just. 
5
All goes well for those gracious in lending,
who conduct their affairs with justice. 
6
They shall never be shaken; the just shall be
remembered forever. 
7
They shall not fear an ill report; their hearts
are steadfast, trusting the LORD. 
8
Their hearts are tranquil, without fear, till
at last they look down on their foes. 
9
[4]
 Lavishly they give to the poor; their
prosperity shall endure forever; their horn shall be exalted in honor. 
10
The wicked shall be angry to see this; they
will gnash their teeth and waste away; the desires of the wicked come to
nothing.

[Psalm 112] An acrostic poem detailing the blessings received by those who
remain close to God by obedience to the commandments. Among their blessings are
children (
⇒
 Psalm 112:2), wealth that enables them
to be magnanimous (
⇒
 Psalm 112:3,
5, 9), and virtue
by which they encourage others (
⇒
 Psalm 112:4). The
just person is an affront to the wicked, whose hopes remain unfulfilled
(
⇒
 Psalm 112:10). The logic resembles Psalms 1;
111.

[1] Happy are those: literally, "Happy the person."
"Person" is used typically, hence the plural translation.

[3] Prosperity: literally, "justice." In the Second Temple Period the
word acquired the nuance of liberality and almsgiving. Cf

 Sirach 3:30;

 Matthew 6:1-4.
