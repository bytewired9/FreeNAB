 [Psalm 111] A temple singer
(
⇒
 Psalm 111:1) tells how God is revealed in
Israel's history (
⇒
 Psalm 111:2-10). The deeds
reveal God's very self, powerful, merciful, faithful. The poem is an acrostic,
each verse beginning with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.

 [1] In the assembled congregation
of the upright: in the temple. Cf 
⇒
 Psalm 149:1.

 [3] Your: the psalm refers to God
in the third person throughout; the shift to the second person is for the sake
of inclusive language.

 [5] Food to those who fear you:
probably a reference to the manna in the desert, which elsewhere is seen as a
type of the Eucharist. Cf 
⇒
 John 6:31-33,
⇒
 49-51.

"inheritance, heritage."

reverence for God, the Hebrew term for religion.
