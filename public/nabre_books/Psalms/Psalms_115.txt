[1]
 Not to us, LORD, not to us but to your name
give glory because of your faithfulness and love. 
2
[2]
 Why should the nations say, "Where is
their God?" 
3
Our God is in heaven; whatever God wills is
done. 
4
Their idols are silver and gold, the work of
human hands. 
5
They have mouths but do not speak, eyes but do
not see. 
6
They have ears but do not hear, noses but do
not smell. 
7
They have hands but do not feel, feet but do not
walk, and no sound rises from their throats. 
8
Their makers shall be like them, all who trust
in them. 
9
[3]
 The house of Israel trusts in the LORD, who is
their help and shield. 
10
The house of Aaron trusts in the LORD, who is
their help and shield. 
11
Those who fear the LORD trust in the LORD, who
is their help and shield. 
12
The LORD remembers us and will bless us, will
bless the house of Israel, will bless the house of Aaron, 
13
Will bless those who fear the LORD, small and
great alike. 
14
May the LORD increase your number, you and your
descendants. 
15
May you be blessed by the LORD, who made heaven
and earth. 
16
[4]
 The heavens belong to the LORD, but the earth
is given to us. 
17
[5]
 The dead do not praise the LORD, all those
gone down into silence. 
18
It is we who bless the LORD, both now and
forever. Hallelujah!

 [Psalm 115] A response to the enemy
taunt, "Where is your God?" This hymn to the glory of Israel's God
(
⇒
 Psalm 115:1-3) ridicules the lifeless idols of
the nations (
⇒
 Psalm 115:4-8), expresses in a
litany the trust of the various classes of the people in God
(
⇒
 Psalm 115:9-11), invokes God's blessing on them
as they invoke the divine name (
⇒
 Psalm
115:12-15), and concludes as it began with praise of God.
⇒
 Psalm 135:15-18 similarly mocks the Gentile gods
and has a similar litany and hymn (
⇒
 Psalm
135:19-21).

 [2] Where is their God?: implies
that God cannot help them.

 [9-11] The house of Israel . . .
the house of Aaron . . . those fear the LORD: the laity of Israelite birth, the
priests, and the converts to Judaism. Cf 
⇒
 Psalm
118:2-4; 
⇒
 135:19-21. In the New
Testament likewise "those who fear the Lord" means converts to
Judaism (cf 
⇒
 Acts 10:2,
⇒
 22, 
⇒
 35;
⇒
 13:16, 
⇒
 26).

"the heaven of heavens" or "the highest heavens," i.e.,
above the firmament. See note on

 Psalm 148:4.
