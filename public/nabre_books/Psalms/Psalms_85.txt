 For the leader. A psalm of the Korahites. 
2
You once favored, LORD, your land, restored the
good fortune of Jacob. 
3
You forgave the guilt of your people, pardoned
all their sins. Selah 
4
You withdrew all your wrath, turned back your
burning anger. 
5
Restore us once more, God our savior; abandon
your wrath against us. 
6
Will you be angry with us forever, drag out
your anger for all generations? 
7
Please give us life again, that your people may
rejoice in you. 
8
Show us, LORD, your love; grant us your
salvation. 
9
[2]
 I will listen for the word of God; surely the
LORD will proclaim peace To his people, to the faithful, to those who trust in
him. 
10
Near indeed is salvation for the loyal;
prosperity will fill our land. 
11
[3]
 Love and truth will meet; justice and peace
will kiss. 
12
Truth will spring from the earth; justice will
look down from heaven. 
13
The LORD will surely grant abundance; our land
will yield its increase. 
14
Prosperity will march before the Lord, and good
fortune will follow behind.

 [Psalm 85] A national lament
reminding God of past favors and forgiveness (
⇒
 Psalm
85:2-4) and begging for forgiveness and grace now
(
⇒
 Psalm 85:5-8). A speaker represents the people
who wait humbly with open hearts (
⇒
 Psalm 85:9-10):
God will be active on their behalf (
⇒
 Psalm
85:11-13). The situation suggests the conditions of Judea during the early
postexilic period, the fifth century B.C.; the thoughts are similar to those of
postexilic prophets (
⇒
 Haggai 1:5-11;
⇒
 2:6-9). 
2
 [9] The prophet listens to God's
revelation. Cf 
⇒
 Hebrews 2:1.

 [11-13] Divine activity is
personified as pairs of virtues.
