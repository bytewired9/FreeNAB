[1]
 For the leader. A psalm of David. I LORD, you
have probed me, you know me: 
2
[2]
 you know when I sit and stand; you understand
my thoughts from afar. 
3
My travels and my rest you mark; with all my ways
you are familiar. 
4
Even before a word is on my tongue, LORD, you
know it all. 
5
Behind and before you encircle me and rest your
hand upon me. 
6
Such knowledge is beyond me, far too lofty for
me to reach. 
7
Where can I hide from your spirit? From your
presence, where can I flee? 
8
If I ascend to the heavens, you are there; if I
lie down in Sheol, you are there too. 
9
[3]
 If I fly with the wings of dawn and alight
beyond the sea, 
10
Even there your hand will guide me, your right
hand hold me fast. 
11
[4]
 If I say, "Surely darkness shall hide me,
and night shall be my light" 
12
Darkness is not dark for you, and night shines
as the day. Darkness and light are but one. 
13
You formed my inmost being; you knit me in my
mother's womb. 
14
I praise you, so wonderfully you made me;
wonderful are your works! My very self you knew; 
15
[5]
 my bones were not hidden from you, When I was
being made in secret, fashioned as in the depths of the earth. 
16
Your eyes foresaw my actions; in your book all
are written down; my days were shaped, before one came to be. 
17
How precious to me are your designs, O God; how
vast the sum of them! 
18
Were I to count, they would outnumber the
sands; to finish, I would need eternity. 
19
If only you would destroy the wicked, O God,
and the bloodthirsty would depart from me! 
20
Deceitfully they invoke your name; your foes
swear faithless oaths. 
21
Do I not hate, LORD, those who hate you? Those
who rise against you, do I not loathe? 
22
With fierce hatred I hate them, enemies I count
as my own. 
23
Probe me, God, know my heart; try me, know my
concerns. 
24
[6]
 See if my way is crooked, then lead me in the
ancient paths.

 [Psalm 139] A hymnic meditation on
God's omnipresence and omniscience. The psalmist is keenly aware of God's
all-knowing gaze (
⇒
 Psalm 139:1-6), of God's
presence in every part of the universe (
⇒
 Psalm
139:7-12), and of God's control over the psalmist's very self
(
⇒
 Psalm 139:13-16). Summing up
⇒
 Psalm 139:1-16,
⇒
 17-18 express wonder. There is only one place
hostile to God's rule - wicked people. The psalmist prays to be removed from
their company (
⇒
 Psalm 139:19-24).

 [2] When I sit and stand: in all my
physical movement.
3
 [9] Fly with the wings of dawn: go
to the extremities of the east. Beyond the sea: uttermost bounds of the west;
the sea is the Mediterranean.
4
 [11] Night shall be my light: night
to me is what day is to others.
5
 [15] The depths of the earth:
figurative language for the womb, stressing the hidden and mysterious
operations that occur there.
6
 [24] My way . . . the ancient
paths: the manner of living of our ancestors, who were faithful to God's will.
