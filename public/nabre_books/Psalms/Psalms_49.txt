 For the leader. A psalm
of the Korahites. 
2
Hear this, all you peoples! Give ear, all who
inhabit the world, 
3
You of lowly birth or high estate, rich and
poor alike. 
4
My mouth shall speak wisdom, my heart shall
offer insight. 
5
[3]
 I will turn my attention to a problem, expound
my question to the music of a lyre. 
6
Why should I fear in evil days, when my wicked
pursuers ring me round, 
7
Those who trust in their wealth and boast of
their abundant riches? 
8
[4]
 One cannot redeem oneself, pay to God a
ransom. 
9
Too high the price to redeem a life; one would
never have enough 
10
To stay alive forever and never see the pit. 
11
Anyone can see that the wisest die, the fool
and the senseless pass away too, and must leave their wealth to others. 
12
Tombs are their homes forever, their dwellings
through all generations, though they gave their names to their lands. 
13
For all their riches mortals do not abide; they
perish like the beasts. 
14
This is the destiny of those who trust in
folly, the end of those so pleased with their wealth. Selah 
15
Like sheep they are herded into Sheol, where
death will be their shepherd. Straight to the grave they descend, where their
form will waste away, Sheol will be their palace. 
16
[5]
 But God will redeem my life, will take me from
the power of Sheol. Selah 
17
Do not fear when others become rich, when the
wealth of their houses grows great. 
18
When they die they will take nothing with them,
their wealth will not follow them down. 
19
When living, they congratulate themselves and
say: "All praise you, you do so well." 
20
But they will join the company of their
forebears, never again to see the light. 
21
For all their riches, if mortals do not have
wisdom, they perish like the beasts.

 [Psalm 49] The psalm affirms
confidence in God (cf Psalm 23; 
⇒
 27:1-6; 62) in the
face of the apparent good fortune of the unjust rich. Cf Psalm 37; 73. Reliance
on wealth is misplaced (
⇒
 Psalm 49:8-10) for it is
of no avail in the face of death (
⇒
 Psalm
49:18-20). After inviting all to listen to this axiom of faith
(
⇒
 Psalm 49:2-5), the psalmist depicts the
self-delusion of the ungodly (
⇒
 Psalm 49:6-13),
whose destiny is to die like ignorant beasts (
⇒
 Psalm
49:13, 
⇒
 18; cf
⇒
 Proverb 7:21-23). Their wealth should occasion no
alarm, for they will come to nought, whereas God will save the just
(
⇒
 Psalm 49:14-20).

⇒
 Psalm 42:1. 
3
 [5] Problem: the psalmist's
personal solution to the perennial biblical problem of the prosperity of the
wicked. Question: parallel in meaning to problem; in Wisdom literature it means
the mysterious way of how the world works.

 [8] One cannot redeem oneself: an
axiom. For the practice of redemption, cf 
⇒
 Job
6:21-23. A play on the first Hebrew word of 
⇒
 Psalm
49:8, 
⇒
 16 relates the two verses.
5
 [16] Will take me: the same Hebrew
verb is used of God "taking up" a favored servant: Enoch in
⇒
 Genesis 5:24; Elijah in 
⇒
 2
Kings 2:11-12; the righteous person in 
⇒
 Psalm
73:24. The verse apparently states the hope that God will rescue the
faithful psalmist in the same manner.
