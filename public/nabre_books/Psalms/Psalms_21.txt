 For the leader. A psalm of David. 
2
LORD, the king finds joy in your power; in your
victory how greatly he rejoices! 
3
You have granted him his heart's desire; you
did not refuse the prayer of his lips. Selah 
4
For you welcomed him with goodly blessings; you
placed on his head a crown of pure gold. 
5
He asked life of you; you gave it to him,
length of days forever. 
6
Great is his glory in your victory; majesty and
splendor you confer upon him. 
7
You make him the pattern of blessings forever,
you gladden him with the joy of your presence. 
8
For the king trusts in the LORD, stands firm
through the love of the Most High. 
9
Your hand will reach all your enemies; your
right hand will reach your foes! 
10
At the time of your coming you will drive them
into a furnace. Then the LORD'S anger will consume them, devour them with fire.
11
Even their descendants you will wipe out from
the earth, their offspring from the human race. 
12
Though they intend evil against you, devising
plots, they will not succeed, 
13
For you will put them to flight; you will aim
at them with your bow. 
14
Arise, LORD, in your power! We will sing and
chant the praise of your might.

 [1] The first part of this royal
psalm is a thanksgiving (
⇒
 Psalm 21:2-8), and the second
is a promise that the king will triumph over his enemies
(
⇒
 Psalm 21:9-13). The king's confident prayer
(
⇒
 Psalm 21:3-5) and trust in God
(
⇒
 Psalm 21:8) enable him to receive the divine
gifts of vitality, peace, and military success.

reprises

 Psalm 21:2. When kings ceased in Israel after the sixth
century B.C., the psalm was sung of a future Davidic king.
