 For the leader; with stringed instruments. Of
David.

Hear my cry, O God, listen to my prayer!

[2]
 From the brink of Sheol I call; my heart grows
faint. Raise me up, set me on a rock,

for you are my refuge, a tower of strength
against the foe.

Then I will ever dwell in your tent, take
refuge in the shelter of your wings. Selah

 O God, when you accept my vows and hear the
plea of those who revere your name in prayer: 
7
"Add to the days of the king's life; may
his years be many generations; 
8
May he reign before God forever; may your love
and fidelity preserve him" -  
9
[4]
 Then I will sing your name forever, fulfill my
vows day after day.
