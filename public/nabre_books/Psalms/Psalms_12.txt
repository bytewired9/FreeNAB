[1]
 For the leader; "upon the eighth." A
psalm of David. 
2
Help, LORD, for no one loyal remains; the
faithful have vanished from the human race 
3
Those who tell lies to one another speak with
deceiving lips and a double heart. 
4
May the LORD cut off all deceiving lips, and
every boastful tongue, 
5
Those who say, "By our tongues we prevail;
when our lips speak, who can lord it over us?" 
6
"Because they rob the weak, and the needy
groan, I will now arise," says the LORD; "I will grant safety to
whoever longs for it." 
7
[2]
 The promises of the LORD are sure, silver
refined in a crucible, silver purified seven times. 
8
LORD, protect us always; preserve us from this
generation. 
9
On every side the wicked strut; the shameless
are extolled by all. 
1
 [Psalm 12] A lament. The psalmist, thrown into a world where
lying and violent people persecute the just (
⇒
 Psalm
12:2-3), prays that the wicked be punished (
⇒
 Psalm
12:4-5). The prayer is not simply for vengeance but arises from a
desire to see God's justice appear on earth. 
⇒
 Psalm
12:6 preserves the word of assurance spoken by the priest to the
lamenter; it is not usually transmitted in such psalms. In
⇒
 Psalm 12:7-8 the psalmist affirms the intention to
live by the word of assurance. 
2
 [Psalm 13] A crucible: lit. "in a crucible in the
ground." The crucible was placed in the ground for support.
