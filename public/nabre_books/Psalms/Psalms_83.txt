 A song; a psalm of Asaph. 
2
God, do not be silent; God, be not still and
unmoved! 
3
See how your enemies rage; your foes proudly
raise their heads. 
4
They conspire against your people, plot against
those you protect. 
5
They say, "Come, let us wipe out their
nation; let Israel's name be mentioned no more!" 
6
They scheme with one mind, in league against
you: 
7
[2]
 The tents of Ishmael and Edom, the people of
Moab and Hagar, 
8
Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia and the
inhabitants of Tyre. 
9
Assyria, too, in league with them gives aid to the
descendants of Lot. Selah 
10
[3]
 Deal with them as with Midian; as with Sisera
and Jabin at the torrent Kishon, 
11
Those destroyed at Endor, who became dung for
the ground. 
12
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their
princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, 
13
Who made a plan together, "Let us seize
the pastures of God." 
14
My God, turn them into withered grass, into
chaff flying before the wind. 
15
As a fire raging through a forest, a flame
setting mountains ablaze, 
16
Pursue them with your tempest; terrify them
with your storm. 
17
Cover their faces with shame, till they pay you
homage, LORD. 
18
Let them be dismayed and shamed forever; let
them perish in disgrace. 
19
Show them you alone are the LORD, the Most High
over all the earth.

 [Psalm 83] The community lament
complains to God of the nations' attempts to wipe out the name of Israel
(
⇒
 Psalm 83:1-8). The psalmist sees all Israel's
enemies throughout its history united in a conspiracy (
⇒
 Psalm
83:2-8). May God destroy the current crop of enemies as the enemies
of old were destroyed (
⇒
 Psalm 83:9-12), and may
they be pursued until they acknowledge the name of Israel's God
(
⇒
 Psalm 83:13-18). 
2
 [7-9] Apart from the Assyrians, all
the nations listed here were neighbors of Israel. The people of . . . Hagar: a
tribe of the desert regions east of Ammon and Moab (
⇒
 1 Chron
5:10, 
⇒
 19-22). Gebal is the Phoenician city
of Byblos or perhaps a mountain region south of the Dead Sea. The descendants
of Lot are Moab and Edom (
⇒
 Genesis 19:36-38 and
⇒
 Deut 2:9). These nations were never united against
Israel in the same period; the psalm has lumped them all together.
