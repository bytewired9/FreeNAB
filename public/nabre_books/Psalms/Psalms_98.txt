[1]
 A psalm. 
[2]
 Sing a new song
to the LORD, who has done marvelous deeds, Whose right hand and holy arm have
won the victory. 
2
The LORD has made his victory known; has
revealed his triumph for the nations to see, 
3
Has remembered faithful love toward the house
of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God. 
4
Shout with joy to the LORD, all the earth;
break into song; sing praise. 
5
Sing praise to the LORD with the harp, with the
harp and melodious song. 
6
With trumpets and the sound of the horn shout
with joy to the King, the LORD. 
7
Let the sea and what fills it resound, the
world and those who dwell there. 
8
Let the rivers clap their hands, the mountains
shout with them for joy, 
9
Before the LORD who comes, who comes to govern
the earth, To govern the world with justice and the peoples with fairness.

 [1] Marvelous deeds . . . victory:
the conquest of all threats to the peaceful existence of Israel, depicted in
the psalms variously as a cosmic force such as sea, or nations bent on Israel's
destruction, or evildoers seemingly triumphant. Whose right hand and holy arm:
God is pictured as a powerful warrior.
