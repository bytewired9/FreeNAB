[1]
 Why do the nations protest and the peoples
grumble in vain? 
2
[2]
 Kings on earth rise up and princes plot
together against the LORD and his anointed: 
3
"Let us break their shackles and cast off
their chains!" 
4
The one enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord
derides them, 
5
Then speaks to them in anger, terrifies them in
wrath: 
6
"I myself have installed my king on Zion,
my holy mountain." 
7
I will proclaim the decree of the LORD, who
said to me, "You are my son; today I am your father. 
8
Only ask it of me, and I will make your
inheritance the nations, your possession the ends of the earth. 
9
With an iron rod you shall shepherd them, like
a clay pot you will shatter them." 
10
And now, kings, give heed; take warning, rulers
on earth. 
11
Serve the LORD with fear; with trembling bow
down in homage, Lest God be angry and you perish from the way in a sudden blaze
of anger. Happy are all who take refuge in God! 
1
 [Psalm 2] royal psalm. To rebellious kings
(
⇒
 Psalm 2:1-3) God responds vigorously
(
⇒
 Psalm 2:4-6). A speaker proclaims the divine
decree (in the legal adoption language of the day), making the Israelite king
the earthly representative of God (
⇒
 Psalm 2:7-9) and
warning kings to obey (
⇒
 Psalm 2:10-11). The psalm
has a messianic meaning for the Church; the New Testament understands it of
Christ (
⇒
 Acts 4:25-27;
⇒
 13:33; 
⇒
 Hebrews 1:5). 
2
 [2] Anointed: in Hebrew mashiah,
"anointed"; in Greek christos, whence English Messiah and Christ. In
Israel kings (
⇒
 Judges 9:8; 
⇒
 1 Sam
9:16; 
⇒
 16:12-13) and high priests
(
⇒
 Lev 8:12; 
⇒
 Numbers
3:3) received the power of their office through anointing.
