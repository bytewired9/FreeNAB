A song of ascents. 
[1]
 To you
I raise my eyes, to you enthroned in heaven. 
2
Yes, like the eyes of a servant on the hand of
his master, Like the eyes of a maid on the hand of her mistress, So our eyes
are on the LORD our God, till we are shown favor. 
3
Show us favor, LORD, show us favor, for we have
our fill of contempt. 
4
We have our fill of insult from the insolent,
of disdain from the arrogant.

 [Psalm 123] A lament that begins as
a prayer of an individual (
⇒
 Psalm 123:1), who
expresses by a touching comparison exemplary confidence in God
(
⇒
 Psalm 123:2). The psalm ends in prayer that God
relieve the people's humiliation at the hands of the arrogant
(
⇒
 Psalm 123:3-4).
