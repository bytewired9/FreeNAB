 [Psalm 136] The hymn praises
Israel's God ("the God of gods," 
⇒
 Psalm
136:2), who has created the world in which Israel lives. The refrain
occurring after every line suggests that a speaker and chorus sang the psalm in
antiphonal fashion. A single act of God is described in
⇒
 Psalm 136:4-25 God arranges the heavens and the
earth as the environment for human community, and then creates the community by
freeing them and giving them land. In the final section
(
⇒
 Psalm 136:23-25) God, who created the people
and gave them land, continues to protect and nurture them.

 [22] A heritage for Israel: the land
was given to Israel by God to be handed on to future generations.
