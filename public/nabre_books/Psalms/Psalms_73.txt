[1]
 A psalm of Asaph. How good God is to the
upright, the Lord, to those who are clean of heart! 
2
I But, as for me, I lost my balance; my feet
all but slipped, 
3
Because I was envious of the arrogant when I
saw the prosperity of the wicked. 
4
For they suffer no pain; their bodies are
healthy and sleek. 
5
They are free of the burdens of life; they are
not afflicted like others. 
6
Thus pride adorns them as a necklace; violence
clothes them as a robe. 
7
Out of their stupidity comes sin; evil thoughts
flood their hearts. 
8
They scoff and spout their malice; from on high
they utter threats. 
9
[2]
 They set their mouths against the heavens,
their tongues roam the earth. 
10
[3]
 So my people turn to them and drink deeply of
their words. 
11
They say, "Does God really know?"
"Does the Most High have any knowledge?" 
12
Such, then, are the wicked, always carefree,
increasing their wealth. 
13
Is it in vain that I have kept my heart clean,
washed my hands in innocence? 
14
For I am afflicted day after day, chastised
every morning. 
15
Had I thought, "I will speak as they
do," I would have betrayed your people. 
16
Though I tried to understand all this, it was
too difficult for me, 
17
[4]
 Till I entered the sanctuary of God and came
to understand their end. 
18
You set them, indeed, on a slippery road; you hurl
them down to ruin. 
19
How suddenly they are devastated; undone by
disasters forever! 
20
They are like a dream after waking, Lord,
dismissed like shadows when you arise. 
21
Since my heart was embittered and my soul
deeply wounded, 
22
I was stupid and could not understand; I was
like a brute beast in your presence. 
23
Yet I am always with you; you take hold of my
right hand. 
24
[5]
 With your counsel you guide me, and at the end
receive me with honor. 
25
Whom else have I in the heavens? None beside
you delights me on earth. 
26
Though my flesh and my heart fail, God is the
rock of my heart, my portion forever. 
27
But those who are far from you perish; you
destroy those unfaithful to you. 
28
As for me, to be near God is my good, to make
the Lord GOD my refuge. I shall declare all your works in the gates of daughter
Zion.

 [Psalm 73] The opening verse of
this probing poem (cf Psalm 37:49) is actually
the psalmist's hard-won conclusion from personal experience: God is just and
good! The psalmist describes near loss of faith (
⇒
 Psalm
73:2-3), occasioned by observing the wicked who blasphemed God with
seeming impunity (
⇒
 Psalm 73:4-12). Feeling
abandoned despite personal righteousness, the psalmist could not bear the
injustice until an experience of God's nearness in the temple made clear how
deluded the wicked were. Their sudden destruction shows their impermanence
(
⇒
 Psalm 73:13-20). The just can thus be confident,
for, as the psalmist now knows, their security is from God
(
⇒
 Psalm 73:1, 
⇒
 23-28).
2
 [9] They set their mouths against
the heavens: in an image probably derived from mythic stories of half-divine
giants, the monstrous speech of the wicked is likened to enormous jaws gaping
wide, devouring everything in sight.
3
 [10] The Hebrew is obscure.
4
 And came to understand their end:
the psalmist receives a double revelation in the temple: 1) the end of the
wicked comes unexpectedly (
⇒
 Psalm 73:18-20); 2)
God is with me.
5
 [24] And at the end receive me with
honor: a perhaps deliberately enigmatic verse. It is understood by some
commentators as reception into heavenly glory, hence the traditional
translation, "receive me into glory." The Hebrew verb can indeed refer
to mysterious divine elevation of a righteous person into God's domain: Enoch
in 
⇒
 Genesis 5:24; Elijah in 
⇒
 2
Kings 2:11-12; the righteous psalmist in 
⇒
 Psalm
49:16. Personal resurrection in the Old Testament, however, is
clearly attested only in the second century B.C. The verse is perhaps best left
unspecified as a reference to God's nearness and protection.
