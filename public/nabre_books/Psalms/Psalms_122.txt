A song of ascents. Of David. 
[1]
I rejoiced when they said to me, "Let us go to the house of the
LORD." 
2
And now our feet are standing within your
gates, Jerusalem. 
3
[2]
 Jerusalem, built as a city, walled round
about. 
4
Here the tribes have come, the tribes of the
LORD, As it was decreed for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD. 
5
Here are the thrones of justice, the thrones of
the house of David. 
6
For the peace of Jerusalem pray: "May
those who love you prosper! 
7
May peace be within your ramparts, prosperity
within your towers." 
8
For family and friends I say, "May peace be
yours." 
9
For the house of the LORD, our God, I pray,
"May blessings be yours."

 [Psalm 122] A song of Zion, sung by
pilgrims obeying the law to visit Jerusalem three times on a journey. The
singer anticipates joining the procession into the city
(
⇒
 Psalm 122:1-3). Jerusalem is a place of
encounter, where the people praise God (
⇒
 Psalm
122:4) and hear the divine justice mediated by the king
(
⇒
 Psalm 112:5). The very buildings bespeak God's
power (cf 
⇒
 Psalm 48:13-15). May the grace of this
place transform the people's lives (
⇒
 Psalm
112:6-9)!

 [3] Walled round about: literally,
"which is joined to it," probably referring both to the density of
the buildings and to the dense population.
