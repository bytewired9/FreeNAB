1
A psalm of David. 
[1]
 I sing
of love and justice; to you, LORD, I sing praise. 
2
[2]
 I follow the way of integrity; when will you
come to me? I act with integrity of heart within my royal court. 
3
I do not allow into my presence anyone who
speaks perversely. Whoever acts shamefully I hate; no such person can be my
friend. 
4
I shun the devious of heart; the wicked I do
not tolerate. 
5
Whoever slanders another in secret I reduce to
silence. Haughty eyes and arrogant hearts I cannot endure. 
6
[3]
 I look to the faithful of the land; they alone
can be my companions. Those who follow the way of integrity, they alone can
enter my service. 
7
No one who practices deceit can hold a post in
my court. No one who speaks falsely can be among my advisors. 
8
[4]
 Each morning I clear the wicked from the land,
and rid the LORD'S city of all evildoers.
1
 [Psalm 101] The king, grateful at
being God's chosen (
⇒
 Psalm 100:1), promises to be
a ruler after God's own heart (
⇒
 Psalm 100:2-3),
allowing into the royal service only the God-fearing (
⇒
 Psalm
100:3-8). 
2
 [2] Within my royal court: the king
promises to make his own household a model for Israel, banning all officials
who abuse their power.
3
 [6] I look to the faithful of the
land: the king seeks companions only among those faithful to God.
4
 [8] Each morning: the normal time
for the administration of justice (
⇒
 2 Sam 15:2;
⇒
 Jeremiah 21:12) and for the arrival of divine aid
(
⇒
 Psalm 59:17;
⇒
 143:8; 
⇒
 Isaiah 33:2).
I clear the wicked from the land: the king, as God's servant, is responsible
for seeing that divine justice is carried out.
