[1]
 For the leader. A song; a psalm. 
2
Shout joyfully to God, all you on earth; sing
of his glorious name; give him glorious praise. 
3
Say to God: "How awesome your deeds!
Before your great strength your enemies cringe. 
4
All on earth fall in worship before you; they
sing of you, sing of your name!" Selah 
5
[2]
 Come and see the works of God, awesome in the
deeds done for us. 
6
He changed the sea to dry land; through the
river they passed on foot. Therefore let us rejoice in him, 
7
who rules by might forever, Whose eyes are fixed
upon the nations. Let no rebel rise to challenge! Selah 
8
Bless our God, you peoples; loudly sound his
praise, 
9
Who has kept us alive and not allowed our feet
to slip. 
10
You tested us, O God, tried us as silver tried
by fire. 
11
You led us into a snare; you bound us at the
waist as captives. 
12
[3]
 You let captors set foot on our neck; we went
through fire and water; then you led us out to freedom. 
13
[4]
 I will bring holocausts to your house; to you
I will fulfill my vows, 
14
The vows my lips pronounced and my mouth spoke
in distress. 
15
Holocausts of fatlings I will offer you and
burnt offerings of rams; I will sacrifice oxen and goats. Selah 
16
Come and hear, all you who fear God, while I
recount what has been done for me. 
17
I called to the Lord with my mouth; praise was
upon my tongue. 
18
Had I cherished evil in my heart, the Lord
would not have heard. 
19
But God did hear and listened to my voice in
prayer. 
20
Blessed be God, who did not refuse me the
kindness I sought in prayer.

 [Psalm 66] In the first part
(
⇒
 Psalm 66:1-12), the community praises God for
powerful acts for Israel, both in the past (the exodus from Egypt and the entry
into the land [
⇒
 Psalm 66:6]) and in the present
(deliverance from a recent but unspecified calamity [Psalm 8-12]). In the
second part (
⇒
 Psalm 66:13-20), an individual from
the rescued community fulfills a vow to offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving. As
often in thanksgivings, the rescued person steps forward to teach the community
what God has done (
⇒
 Psalm 66:16-20).

 [12] You let captors set foot on
our neck: literally, "you let men mount our head." Conquerors placed
their feet on the neck of their enemies as a sign of complete defeat. Cf
⇒
 Joshua 10:24. A ceremonial footstool of the
Egyptian king Tutankhamen portrays bound and prostrate bodies of enemies ready
for the king's feet on their heads, and one of Tutankhamen's ceremonial
chariots depicts the king as a sphinx standing with paw atop the neck of an
enemy.

offerings. Cf
