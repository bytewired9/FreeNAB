 [Psalm 150] The psalm is a closing
doxology both for the fifth book of the Psalms (Psalm 150:107-149)
and for the Psalter as a whole. Temple musicians and dancers are called to lead
all beings on earth and in heaven in praise of God. The psalm proclaims to whom
praise shall be given, and where (
⇒
 Psalm 150:1);
what praise shall be given, and why (
⇒
 Psalm
150:2); how praise shall be given (
⇒
 Psalm
150:3-5), and by whom (
⇒
 Psalm 150:6).

 [1] His holy sanctuary: God's
temple on earth. The mighty dome of the heavens: literally, "[God's]
strong vault"; heaven is here imagined as a giant plate separating the
inhabited world from the waters of the heavens.
