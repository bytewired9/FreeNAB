[1]
 A song of ascents. 
[2]
 Out of
the depths I call to you, LORD; 
2
Lord, hear my cry! May your ears be attentive
to my cry for mercy. 
3
If you, LORD, mark our sins, Lord, who can
stand? 
4
[3]
 But with you is forgiveness and so you are
revered. 
5
I wait with longing for the LORD, my soul waits
for his word. 
6
My soul looks for the Lord more than sentinels
for daybreak. More than sentinels for daybreak, 
7
let Israel look for the LORD, For with the LORD
is kindness, with him is full redemption, 
8
And God will redeem Israel from all their sins.

 [Psalm 130] This lament, a
Penitential Psalm, is the De profundis used in liturgical prayers for the
faithful departed. In deep sorrow the psalmist cries to God
(
⇒
 Psalm 130:1-2), asking for mercy
(
⇒
 Psalm 130:3-4). The psalmist's trust
(
⇒
 Psalm 130:5-6) becomes a model for the people
(
⇒
 Psalm 130:7-8).
2
 [1] The depths: Sheol here is a
metaphor of total misery. Deep anguish makes the psalmist feel "like those
descending to the pit" (
⇒
 Psalm 143:7). 
3
 [4] And so you are revered: the
experience of God's mercy leads one to a greater sense of God.
