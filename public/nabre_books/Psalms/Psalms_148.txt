Hallelujah! 
[1]
 Praise the
LORD from the heavens; give praise in the heights. 
2
Praise him, all you angels; give praise, all
you hosts. 
3
Praise him, sun and moon; give praise, all
shining stars. 
4
[2]
 Praise him, highest heavens, you waters above
the heavens. 
5
Let them all praise the LORD'S name; for the
LORD commanded and they were created, 
6
Assigned them duties forever, gave them tasks
that will never change. 
7
Praise the LORD from the earth, you sea
monsters and all deep waters; 
8
You lightning and hail, snow and clouds, storm
winds that fulfill his command; 
9
You mountains and all hills, fruit trees and
all cedars; 
10
You animals wild and tame, you creatures that
crawl and fly; 
11
You kings of the earth and all peoples, princes
and all who govern on earth; 
12
Young men and women too, old and young alike. 
13
Let them all praise the LORD'S name, for his
name alone is exalted, majestic above earth and heaven.

[3]
 The LORD has lifted high the horn of his
people; to the glory of all the faithful, of Israel, the people near to their
God. Hallelujah!
