A prayer of David. 
[1]
 Hear,
LORD, my plea for justice; pay heed to my cry; Listen to my prayer spoken
without guile. 
2
From you let my vindication come; your eyes see
what is right. 
3
You have tested my heart, searched it in the
night. You have tried me by fire, but find no malice in me. My mouth has not
transgressed 
4
as humans often do. As your lips have
instructed me, I have kept the way of the law. 
5
My steps have kept to your paths; my feet have
not faltered. 
6
I call upon you; answer me, O God. Turn your
ear to me; hear my prayer. 
7
Show your wonderful love, you who deliver with
your right arm those who seek refuge from their foes. 
8
[2]
 Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in
the shadow of your wings 
9
from the violence of the wicked. 
10
[3]
 My ravenous enemies press upon me; they close
their hearts, they fill their mouths with proud roaring. 
11
Their steps even now encircle me; they watch
closely, keeping low to the ground, 
12
Like lions eager for prey, like young lions
lurking in ambush. 
13
Rise, O LORD, confront and cast them down;
rescue me so from the wicked. 
14
Slay them with your sword; with your hand,
LORD, slay them; snatch them from the world in their prime. Their bellies are
being filled with your friends; their children are satisfied too, for they
share what is left with their young. 
15
[4]
 I am just - let me see your face; when I
awake, let me be filled with your presence.

 [Psalm 17] A lament of an
individual unjustly attacked who has taken refuge in the temple. Confident of
being found innocent, the psalmist cries out for God's just judgment
(
⇒
 Psalm 17:1-5) and requests divine help against
enemies (
⇒
 Psalm 17:6-9a). Those ravenous lions
(
⇒
 Psalm 17:9b-12) should be punished
(
⇒
 Psalm 17:13-14). The psalm ends with a serene
statement of praise (
⇒
 Psalm 17:15). The Hebrew
text of 
⇒
 Psalm 17:3-4,
⇒
 14 is uncertain.

 [8] Apple of your eye . . . shadow
of your wings: images of God's special care. Cf 
⇒
 Deut
32:10; 
⇒
 Proverb 7:2;
⇒
 Isaiah 49:2.
3
 [10-12,14] An extended metaphor:
the enemies are lions.

 [15] When I awake: probably the psalmist
has spent the night in the sanctuary (cf 
⇒
 Psalm
17:3) and hopes to wake to an oracle assuring God's protective
presence.
