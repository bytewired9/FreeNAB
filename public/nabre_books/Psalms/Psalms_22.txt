[2]
 For the leader; according
to "The deer of the dawn." A psalm of David. 
2
My God, my God, why have you abandoned me? Why
so far from my call for help, from my cries of anguish? 
3
My God, I call by day, but you do not answer;
by night, but I have no relief. 
4
Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One; you are
the glory of Israel. 
5
In you our ancestors trusted; they trusted and
you rescued them. 
6
To you they cried out and they escaped; in you
they trusted and were not disappointed. 
7
[3]
 But I am a worm, hardly human, scorned by
everyone, despised by the people. 
8
All who see me mock me; they curl their lips
and jeer; they shake their heads at me: 
9
"You relied on the LORD - let him deliver
you; if he loves you, let him rescue you." 
10
Yet you drew me forth from the womb, made me
safe at my mother's breast. 
11
Upon you I was thrust from the womb; since
birth you are my God. 
12
Do not stay far from me, for trouble is near,
and there is no one to help. 
13
[4]
 Many bulls surround me; fierce bulls of Bashan
encircle me. 
14
They open their mouths against me, lions that
rend and roar. 
15
Like water my life drains away; all my bones
grow soft. My heart has become like wax, it melts away within me. 
16
[5]
 As dry as a potsherd is my throat; my tongue
sticks to my palate; you lay me in the dust of death. 
17
Many dogs surround me; a pack of evildoers
closes in on me. So wasted are my hands and feet 
18
that I can count all my bones. They stare at me
and gloat; 
19
they divide my garments among them; for my
clothing they cast lots. 
20
But you, LORD, do not stay far off; my
strength, come quickly to help me. 
21
Deliver me from the sword, my forlorn life from
the teeth of the dog. 
22
Save me from the lion's mouth, my poor life
from the horns of wild bulls. 
23
[6]
 Then I will proclaim your name to the
assembly; in the community I will praise you: 
24
"You who fear the LORD, give praise! All
descendants of Jacob, give honor; show reverence, all descendants of Israel! 
25
[7]
 For God has not spurned or disdained the
misery of this poor wretch, Did not turn away from me, but heard me when I
cried out. 
26
I will offer praise in the great assembly; my
vows I will fulfill before those who fear him. 
27
[8]
 The poor will eat their fill; those who seek
the LORD will offer praise. May your hearts enjoy life forever!" 
28
All the ends of the earth will worship and turn
to the LORD; All the families of nations will bow low before you. 
29
For kingship belongs to the LORD, the ruler
over the nations. 
30
[9]
 All who sleep in the earth will bow low before
God; All who have gone down into the dust will kneel in homage. 
31
And I will live for the LORD; my descendants
will serve you. 
32
The generation to come will be told of the
Lord, that they may proclaim to a people yet unborn the deliverance you have
brought. 
1
 [Psalm 22] A lament unusual in
structure and in intensity of feeling. The psalmist's present distress is
contrasted with God's past mercy in 
⇒
 Psalm 22:2-12.
In 
⇒
 Psalm 22:13-22 enemies surround the psalmist.
The last third is an invitation to praise God (
⇒
 Psalm
22:23-27), becoming a universal chorus of praise
(
⇒
 Psalm 22:28-31). The psalm is important in the
New Testament. Its opening words occur on the lips of the crucified Jesus
(
⇒
 Mark 15:34; 
⇒
 Matthew
27:46), and several other verses are quoted, or at least alluded to,
in the accounts of Jesus' passion (
⇒
 Matthew 27:35,
⇒
 43; 
⇒
 John 19:24).
2
 [1] The deer of the dawn:
apparently the title of the melody. 
3
 [7] I am a worm, hardly human: the
psalmist's sense of isolation and dehumanization, an important motif of Psalm
22 is vividly portrayed here.
4
 [13-14] Bulls: the enemies of the
psalmist are also portrayed in less-than-human form, as wild animals (cf
⇒
 Psalm 22:17, 
⇒
 21-22).
Bashan: a grazing land east of the Jordan, famed for its cattle. Cf
⇒
 Deut 32:14; 
⇒
 Ezekiel
39:18; 
⇒
 Amos 4:1
5
 [16] The dust of death: the
netherworld, the domain of the dead.
6
 [23] In the community I will praise
you: the person who offered a thanksgiving sacrifice in the temple recounted to
the other worshipers the favor received from God and invited them to share in
the sacrificial banquet. The final section (
⇒
 Psalm
22:24-32) may be a summary or a citation of the psalmist's poem of
praise.
7
 [25] Turn away: literally,
"hides his face from me," an important metaphor for God withdrawing from
someone, e.g., 
⇒
 Micah 3:4; 
⇒
 Isaiah
8:17; 
⇒
 Psalm 27:9;
⇒
 69:18; 
⇒
 88:15.
8
 [27] The poor: originally the poor,
who were dependent on God; the term ('anawim) came to include the religious
sense of "humble, pious, devout."
9
 [30] Hebrew unclear. The
translation assumes that all on earth (
⇒
 Psalm
22:27-28) and under the earth (
⇒
 Psalm
22:29) will worship God.
