 Of David.

 I thank you,
LORD, with all my heart; before the gods to you I sing. 
2
I bow low toward your holy temple; I praise
your name for your fidelity and love. For you have exalted over all your name
and your promise. 
3
When I cried out, you answered; you
strengthened my spirit. 
4
All the kings of earth will praise you, LORD,
when they hear the words of your mouth. 
5
They will sing of the ways of the LORD:
"How great is the glory of the LORD!" 
6
The LORD is on high, but cares for the lowly
and knows the proud from afar. 
7
Though I walk in the midst of dangers, you
guard my life when my enemies rage. You stretch out your hand; your right hand
saves me. 
8
The LORD is with me to the end. LORD, your love
endures forever. Never forsake the work of your hands!

 [Psalm 138] A thanksgiving to God,
who came to the rescue of the psalmist. Divine rescue was not the result of the
psalmist's virtues but of God's loving fidelity (
⇒
 Psalm
138:1-3). The act is not a private transaction but a public act that
stirs the surrounding nations to praise God's greatness and care for the people
(
⇒
 Psalm 138:4-6). The psalmist, having experienced
salvation, trusts that God will always be there in moments of danger
(
⇒
 Psalm 138:7-8).

beings, who were completely subordinate to Israel's God. The earthly temple
represents the heavenly palace of God.
