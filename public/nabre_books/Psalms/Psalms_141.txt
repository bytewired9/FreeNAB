[1]
 A psalm of David. LORD, I call to you; come
quickly to help me; listen to my plea when I call. 
2
[2]
 Let my prayer be incense before you; my
uplifted hands an evening sacrifice. 
3
Set a guard, LORD, before my mouth, a
gatekeeper at my lips. 
4
Do not let my heart incline to evil, or yield
to any sin. I will never feast upon the fine food of evildoers. 
5
[3]
 Let the just strike me; that is kindness; let
them rebuke me; that is oil for my head. All this I shall not refuse, but will
pray despite these trials. 
6
When their leaders are cast over the cliff, all
will learn that my prayers were heard. 
7
As when a farmer plows a field into broken
clods, so their bones will be strewn at the mouth of Sheol. 
8
My eyes are upon you, O GOD, my Lord; in you I
take refuge; do not strip me of life. 
9
Guard me from the trap they have set for me,
from the snares of evildoers. 
10
Into their own nets let all the wicked fall,
while I make good my own escape.
