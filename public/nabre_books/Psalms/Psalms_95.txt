[1]
 Come, let us sing joyfully to the LORD; cry
out to the rock of our salvation. 
2
Let us greet him with a song of praise,
joyfully sing out our psalms. 
3
For the LORD is the great God, the great king
over all gods, 
4
Whose hand holds the depths of the earth; who
owns the tops of the mountains. 
5
The sea and dry land belong to God, who made
them, formed them by hand. 
6
Enter, let us bow down in worship; let us kneel
before the LORD who made us. 
7
For this is our God, whose people we are, God's
well-tended flock. Oh, that today you would hear his voice: 
8
[2]
 Do not harden your hearts as at Meribah, as on
the day of Massah in the desert. 
9
There your ancestors tested me; they tried me
though they had seen my works. 
10
Forty years I loathed that generation; I said:
"This people's heart goes astray; they do not know my ways." 
11
[3]
 Therefore I swore in my anger: "They
shall never enter my rest."

 [Psalm 95] Twice the psalm calls
the people to praise and worship God (
⇒
 Psalm
95:1-2, 6), the king of all creatures
(
⇒
 Psalm 95:3-5) and shepherd of the flock
(
⇒
 Psalm 95:7a, 
⇒
 7b).
The last strophe warns the people to be more faithful than were their ancestors
in the journey to the promised land (
⇒
 Psalm
95:7c-11). This invitation to praise God regularly opens the Church's
official prayer, the Liturgy of the Hours.

 [8] Meribah: literally,
"contention"; the place where the Israelites quarreled with God.
Massah: "testing," the place where they put God to the trial. Cf
⇒
 Exodus 17:7; 
⇒
 Numbers
20:13.

 [11] My rest: the promised land as
in 
⇒
 Deut 12:9. Hebrews 4 applies the verse to the
eternal rest of heaven.
