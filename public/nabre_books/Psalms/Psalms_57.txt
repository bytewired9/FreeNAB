 For the director. Do not
destroy. A miktam of David, when he fled from Saul into a cave. 
2
Have mercy on me, God, have mercy on me. In you
I seek shelter. In the shadow of your wings 
[3]
 I seek shelter
till harm pass by. 
3
I call to God Most High, to God who provides
for me. 
4
May God send help from heaven to save me, shame
those who trample upon me. May God send fidelity and love. Selah 
5
I must lie down in the midst of lions hungry
for human prey. Their teeth are spears and arrows; their tongue, a sharpened
sword. 
6
Show yourself over the heavens, God; may your
glory appear above all the earth. 
7
They have set a trap for my feet; my soul is
bowed down; They have dug a pit before me. May they fall into it themselves!
Selah 
8
My heart is steadfast, God, my heart is
steadfast. I will sing and chant praise. 
9
[4]
 Awake, my soul; awake, lyre and harp! I will
wake the dawn. 
10
I will praise you among the peoples, Lord; I
will chant your praise among the nations. 
11
For your love towers to the heavens; your
faithfulness, to the skies. 
12
Show yourself over the heavens, God; may your glory
appear above all the earth.

 [Psalm 57] Each of the two equal
strophes contains a prayer for rescue from enemies, accompanied by joyful trust
in God (
⇒
 Psalm 57:2-5, 
⇒
 7-11).
The refrain prays that God be manifested as saving (
⇒
 Psalm
57:6, 
⇒
 11[12]). Psalm 108 is nearly
identical to part of this psalm (
⇒
 Psalm 57:8-11 = 
⇒
 Psalm
108:2-6).

 [1] Do not destroy: probably the
title of the melody to which the psalm was to be sung. 
3
 [2] The shadow of your wings: probably
refers to the wings of the cherubim (powerful winged animals) whose wings
spread over the ark in the inner chamber of the temple (
⇒
 1
Kings 6:23-28).

 [9] I will wake the dawn: by a bold
figure the psalmist imagines the sound of music and singing will waken a new
day.
