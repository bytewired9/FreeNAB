 For the leader; according to "The Lily
of...." A miktam of David (for teaching),

when he fought against Aram-Naharaim and
Aram-Zobah; and Joab, coming back, killed twelve thousand Edomites in the
Valley of Salt. 
3
O God, you rejected us, broke our defenses; you
were angry but now revive us. 
4
You rocked the earth, split it open; repair the
cracks for it totters. 
5
You made your people go through hardship, made
us stagger from the wine you gave us. 
6
Raise up a flag for those who revere you, a
refuge for them out of bow shot. Selah 
7
[2]
 Help with your right hand and answer us that
your loved ones may escape.

 In the sanctuary God promised: "I will
exult, will apportion Shechem; the valley of Succoth I will measure out. 
9
[4]
 Gilead is mine, mine is Manasseh; Ephraim is
the helmet for my head, Judah, my own scepter. 
10
[5]
 Moab is my washbowl; upon Edom I cast my
sandal. I will triumph over Philistia." 
11
[6]
 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who
will lead me into Edom? 
12
Was it not you who rejected us, God? Do you no
longer march with our armies? 
13
Give us aid against the foe; worthless is human
help. 
14
We will triumph with the help of God, who will
trample down our foes.

 [Psalm 60] The community complains
that God has let the enemy win the battle (
⇒
 Psalm
60:3-5) and asks for an assurance of victory
(
⇒
 Psalm 60:6-7). In the oracle God affirms
ownership of the land; the invasion of other nations is not permanent and will
be reversed ultimately (
⇒
 Psalm 60:8-10). With
renewed confidence, the community resolves to fight again
(
⇒
 Psalm 60:11). The opening lament is picked up
again (
⇒
 Psalm 60:12), but this time with new
awareness of God's power and human limitation.

 [7-12] These verses occur again as
the second half of Psalm 108.

 [8] I will apportion . . . measure
out: God lays claim to these places. The valley of Succoth: probably the lower
stretch of the Jabbok valley.

 [9] Judah, my own scepter: an
allusion to the Testament of Jacob, 
⇒
 Genesis 49:10.
5
 [10] Moab is my washbowl: Moab
borders the Dead Sea, hence a metaphor for the country. Upon Edom I cast my
sandal: an ancient legal gesture of taking possession of land.

 [11] The fortified city: perhaps
Bozrah, the fortified capital of Edom. Cf

34:6;

 63:1;

 Amos
1:12.
