[1]
 For the leader; "upon the gittith."
A psalm of the Korahites. 
2
How lovely your dwelling, O LORD of hosts! 
3
My soul yearns and pines for the courts of the
LORD. My heart and flesh cry out for the living God. 
4
[2]
 As the sparrow finds a home and the swallow a
nest to settle her young, My home is by your altars, LORD of hosts, my king and
my God! 
5
Happy are those who dwell in your house! They
never cease to praise you. Selah 
6
Happy are those who find refuge in you, whose
hearts are set on pilgrim roads.

[3]
 As they pass through the Baca valley, they
find spring water to drink. Also from pools the Lord provides water for those
who lose their way. 
8
They pass through outer and inner wall and see
the God of gods on Zion. 
9
LORD of hosts, hear my prayer; listen, God of
Jacob. Selah 
10
[4]
 O God, look kindly on our shield; look upon
the face of your anointed. 
11
Better one day in your courts than a thousand
elsewhere. Better the threshold of the house of my God than a home in the tents
of the wicked. 
12
For a sun and shield is the LORD God, bestowing
all grace and glory. The LORD withholds no good thing from those who walk
without reproach. 
13
O LORD of hosts, happy are those who trust in
you!
