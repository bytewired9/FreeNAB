For the leader; a psalm with stringed
instruments. A song of Asaph.

[1]
 Renowned in Judah is God, whose name is great
in Israel. 
3
[2]
 On Salem is God's tent, a shelter on Zion. 
4
There the flashing arrows were shattered,
shield, sword, and weapons of war. Selah 
5
[3]
 Terrible and awesome are you, stronger than
the ancient mountains. 
6
Despoiled are the bold warriors; they sleep
their final sleep; the hands of all the mighty have failed. 
7
At your roar, O God of Jacob, chariots and
steeds lay still. 
8
So terrible and awesome are you; who can stand
before you and your great anger? 
9
From the heavens you pronounced sentence; the
earth was terrified and reduced to silence, 
10
When you arose, O God, for judgment to deliver
the afflicted of the land. Selah 
11
[4]
 Even wrathful Edom praises you; the remnant of
Hamath keeps your feast. 
12
Make and keep vows to the LORD your God. May
all present bring gifts to this awesome God, 
13
Who checks the pride of princes, inspires awe
among the kings of earth.

 [Psalm 76] A song glorifying Zion,
the mountain of Jerusalem
where God destroyed Israel's
enemies. Zion is thus the appropriate site to celebrate the victory
(
⇒
 Psalm 76:3-4), a victory described in parallel
scenes (
⇒
 Psalm 76:5-7,
⇒
 8-11). Israel is invited to worship its powerful
patron deity (
⇒
 Psalm 76:12).

 [3] Salem: an ancient name for
Jerusalem, used here perhaps on account of its allusion to the Hebrew word for
peace, shalom. Cf

⇒
 Hebrews 7:1-3.

 [5] Ancient mountains: conjectural
translation of a difficult Hebrew phrase on the basis of

 Genesis 49:26. The mountains are part of the
structure of the universe (

 Psalm 89:12-13).

 [11] Edom . . . Hamath: conjectural
translation. Israel's neighbors to the southeast and north.
