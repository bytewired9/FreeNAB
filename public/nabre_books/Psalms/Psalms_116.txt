[1]
 I love the LORD, who listened to my voice in
supplication, 
2
Who turned an ear to me on the day I called. 
3
[2]
 I was caught by the cords of death; the snares
of Sheol had seized me; I felt agony and dread. 
4
Then I called on the name of the LORD, "O
LORD, save my life!" 
5
Gracious is the LORD and just; yes, our God is
merciful. 
6
The LORD protects the simple; I was helpless,
but God saved me. 
7
Return, my soul, to your rest; the LORD has
been good to you. 
8
For my soul has been freed from death, my eyes
from tears, my feet from stumbling. 
9
[3]
 I shall walk before the LORD in the land of
the living. 
10
[4]
 I kept faith, even when I said, "I am
greatly afflicted!" 
11
I said in my alarm, "No one can be
trusted!" 
12
How can I repay the LORD for all the good done
for me? 
13
[5]
 I will raise the cup of salvation and call on
the name of the LORD. 
14
I will pay my vows to the LORD in the presence of
all his people. 
15
[6]
 Too costly in the eyes of the LORD is the
death of his faithful. 
16
LORD, I am your servant, your servant, the
child of your maidservant; you have loosed my bonds. 
17
I will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving and
call on the name of the LORD. 
18
I will pay my vows to the LORD in the presence
of all his people, 
19
In the courts of the house of the LORD, in your
midst, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
1
 [Psalm 116] A thanksgiving in which
the psalmist responds to divine rescue from mortal danger (
⇒
 Psalm
116:3-4) and from near despair (10-11) with vows and temple
sacrifices (
⇒
 Psalm 116:13-14,
⇒
 17-19). The Greek and Latin versions divide the
psalm into two parts: 
⇒
 Psalm 116:1-9 and 10-19,
corresponding to its two major divisions. 
2
 [3] The cords of death: death is
personified here; it attempts to capture the psalmist with snares and nets. Cf 
⇒
 Psalm
18:6.
3
 [9] The land of the living: the
phrase elsewhere is an epithet of the Jerusalem Temple (cf
⇒
 Psalm 27:13; 
⇒
 52:5;
⇒
 Isaiah 38:11). Hence the psalmist probably refers
to being present to God in the temple.
4
 [10] I kept faith, even when I
said: even in the days of despair, the psalmist did not lose all hope.
5
 [13] The cup of salvation: probably
the libation of wine poured out in gratitude for rescue. Cf
⇒
 Exodus 25:29; 
⇒
 Numbers
15:5, 7,
⇒
 10.
6
 [15] Too costly in the eyes of the
LORD: the meaning is that the death of God's faithful is grievous to God, not
that God is pleased with the death. Cf 
⇒
 Psalm
72:14. In 
⇒
 Wisdom 3:5-6 God accepts the
death of the righteous as a sacrificial burnt offering.
