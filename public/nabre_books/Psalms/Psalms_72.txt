Of Solomon. 
2
[1]
[2]
 O God, give your judgment
to the king; your justice to the son of kings; That he may govern your people
with justice, your oppressed with right judgment, 
3
That the mountains may yield their bounty for
the people, and the hills great abundance, 
4
That he may defend the oppressed among the
people, save the poor and crush the oppressor. 
5
May he live as long as the sun endures, like
the moon, through all generations. 
6
May he be like rain coming down upon the
fields, like showers watering the earth, 
7
That abundance may flourish in his days, great
bounty, till the moon be no more. 
8
[3]
 May he rule from sea to sea, from the river to
the ends of the earth. 
9
May his foes kneel before him, his enemies lick
the dust. 
10
[4]
 May the kings of Tarshish and the islands
bring tribute, the kings of Arabia and Seba offer gifts. 
11
May all kings bow before him, all nations serve
him. 
12
For he rescues the poor when they cry out, the
oppressed who have no one to help. 
13
He shows pity to the needy and the poor and
saves the lives of the poor. 
14
[5]
 From extortion and violence he frees them, for
precious is their blood in his sight. 
15
Long may he live, receiving gold from Arabia,
prayed for without cease, blessed day by day. 
16
[6]
 May wheat abound in the land, flourish even on
the mountain heights. May his fruit increase like Lebanon's, his wheat like the
grasses of the land. 
17
[7]
 May his name be blessed forever; as long as
the sun, may his name endure. May the tribes of the earth give blessings with
his name; may all the nations regard him as favored. 
18
[8]
 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who
alone does wonderful deeds. 
19
Blessed be his glorious name forever; may all
the earth be filled with the LORD'S glory. Amen and amen.

The end of the psalms of David, son of Jesse. 
1
 [Psalm 72] A royal psalm in which
the Israelite king, as the representative of God, is the instrument of divine
justice (
⇒
 Psalm 72:1-4,
⇒
 12-14) and blessing (
⇒
 Psalm
72:5-7, 
⇒
 15-17) for the whole world. The
king is human, giving only what he has received from God. Hence intercession
must be made for him. The extravagant language is typical of oriental royal
courts.
2
 [2] The king . . . the son of
kings: the crown prince is the king's son; the prayer envisages the dynasty. 
3
 [8] From sea to sea . . . the ends
of the earth: the boundaries of the civilized world known at the time: from the
Mediterranean Sea (the western sea) to the Persian Gulf (the eastern sea), and
from the Euphrates (the river) to the islands and lands of southwestern Europe,
"the ends of the earth." The words may also have a mythic nuance -
the earth surrounded by cosmic waters, hence everywhere.
4
 [10] Tarshish and the islands: the far
west (
⇒
 Psalm 48:6); Arabia and Seba: the far south
(
⇒
 1 Kings 10:1).
5
 [14] Their blood: cf
⇒
 Psalm 116:15.
6
 [16] The translation of the
difficult Hebrew is tentative.
7
 [17] May the tribes of the earth
give blessing with his name: an echo of the promise to the ancestors
(
⇒
 Genesis 12:3; 
⇒
 26:4;
⇒
 28:14), suggesting that the monarchy in Israel
fulfilled the promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
