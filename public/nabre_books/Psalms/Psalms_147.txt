1
Hallelujah! 
[1]
 How good to
celebrate our God in song; how sweet to give fitting praise. 
2
The LORD rebuilds Jerusalem, gathers the
dispersed of Israel, 
3
Heals the brokenhearted, binds up their wounds,
4
Numbers all the stars, calls each of them by
name. 
5
Great is our Lord, vast in power, with wisdom
beyond measure. 
6
The LORD sustains the poor, but casts the
wicked to the ground. 
7
Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; with the
lyre celebrate our God, 
8
[2]
 Who covers the heavens with clouds, provides
rain for the earth, makes grass sprout on the mountains, 
9
Who gives animals their food and ravens what
they cry for. 
10
[3]
 God takes no delight in the strength of
horses, no pleasure in the runner's stride. 
11
Rather the LORD takes pleasure in the devout,
those who await his faithful care. 
12
Glorify the LORD, Jerusalem; Zion, offer praise
to your God, 
13
Who has strengthened the bars of your gates,
blessed your children within you, 
14
Brought peace to your borders, and filled you
with finest wheat. 
15
[4]
 The LORD sends a command to earth; his word
runs swiftly! 
16
Thus snow is spread like wool, frost is
scattered like ash, 
17
Hail is dispersed like crumbs; before such cold
the waters freeze. 
18
Again he sends his word and they melt; the wind
is unleashed and the waters flow. 
19
The LORD also proclaims his word to Jacob,
decrees and laws to Israel. 
20
God has not done this for other nations; of
such laws they know nothing. Hallelujah!

 [Psalm 147] The hymn is divided
into three sections by the calls to praise in 
⇒
 Psalm 147:1;
7,12. The first section praises the powerful creator who restores exiled Judah
(
⇒
 Psalm 147:1-6); the second section, the creator
who provides food to animals and humans; the third and climactic section
exhorts the holy city to recognize it has been re-created and made the place of
disclosure for God's word, a word as life-giving as water. 
2
 [8-9] God clothes the fields and
feeds the birds. Cf 
⇒
 Matthew 6:26,
⇒
 30.
3
 [10-11] Acknowledging one's
dependence upon God rather than claiming self-sufficiency pleases God. Cf
⇒
 Psalm 20:8;
⇒
 33:16-19.
4
 [15-19] God speaks through the
thunder of nature and the word of revealed law. Cf 
⇒
 Isaiah
55:10-11. The weather phenomena are well known in Jerusalem: a
blizzard of snow and hail followed by a thunderstorm that melts the ice.
