[2]
 For the leader; al
Jeduthun. A psalm of David. 
2
My soul rests in God alone, from whom comes my
salvation. 
3
God alone is my rock and salvation, my secure
height; I shall never fall. 
4
How long will you set upon people, all of you
beating them down, As though they were a sagging fence or a battered wall? 
5
Even from my place on high they plot to
dislodge me. They delight in lies; they bless with their mouths, but inwardly
they curse. Selah 
6
My soul, be at rest in God alone, from whom
comes my hope. 
7
God alone is my rock and my salvation, my
secure height; I shall not fall. 
8
My safety and glory are with God, my strong
rock and refuge. 
9
Trust God at all times, my people! Pour out
your hearts to God our refuge! Selah 
10
[3]
 Mortals are a mere breath, the powerful but an
illusion; On a balance they rise; together they are lighter than air. 
11
Do not trust in extortion; in plunder put no
empty hope. Though wealth increase, do not set your heart upon it. 
12
[4]
 One thing God has said; two things I have
heard: Power belongs to God; 
13
3) so too, Lord, does kindness,
And you render to each of us according to our deeds.

 [Psalm 62] A song of trust
displaying serenity from experiencing God's power (the refrains of
⇒
 Psalm 62:2-3 and 
⇒
 Psalm
62:6-7) and anger toward unjust enemies (
⇒
 Psalm
62:4-5). From the experience of being rescued, the psalmist can teach
others to trust in God (
⇒
 Psalm 62:9-12).

Hebrew name for the melody.

 [10] On a balance they rise:
precious objects were weighed by balancing two pans suspended from a beam. The
lighter pan rises.

 [12] One thing . . . two things:
parallelism of numbers for the sake of variation, a common device in Semitic
poetry. One should not literally add up the numbers. Cf
