[1]
 Rejoice, you just, in the LORD; praise from
the upright is fitting. 
2
Give thanks to the LORD on the harp; on the ten-stringed
lyre offer praise. 
3
Sing to God a new song; skillfully play with
joyful chant. 
4
For the LORD'S word is true; all his works are
trustworthy. 
5
The LORD loves justice and right and fills the
earth with goodness. 
6
[2]
 By the LORD'S word the heavens were made; by
the breath of his mouth all their host. 
7
[3]
 The waters of the sea were gathered as in a
bowl; in cellars the deep was confined. 
8
Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all who
dwell in the world show reverence. 
9
For he spoke, and it came to be, commanded, and
it stood in place. 
10
The LORD foils the plan of nations, frustrates
the designs of peoples. 
11
But the plan of the LORD stands forever, wise
designs through all generations. 
12
Happy the nation whose God is the LORD, the
people chosen as his very own. 
13
From heaven the LORD looks down and observes
the whole human race, 
14
Surveying from the royal throne all who dwell
on earth. 
15
The one who fashioned the hearts of them all
knows all their works. 
16
A king is not saved by a mighty army, nor a
warrior delivered by great strength. 
17
Useless is the horse for safety; its great
strength, no sure escape. 
18
But the LORD'S eyes are upon the reverent, upon
those who hope for his gracious help, 
19
Delivering them from death, keeping them alive
in times of famine. 
20
Our soul waits for the LORD, who is our help
and shield. 
21
For in God our hearts rejoice; in your holy
name we trust. 
22
May your kindness, LORD, be upon us; we have
put our hope in you.

 [Psalm 33] A hymn in which the just
are invited (
⇒
 Psalm 33:1-3) to praise God, who by a
mere word (
⇒
 Psalm 33:4-5) created the three-tiered
universe of the heavens, the cosmic waters, and the earth
(
⇒
 Psalm 33:6-9). Human words, in contrast, effect
nothing (
⇒
 Psalm 33:10-11). The greatness of human
beings consists in God's choosing them as a special people and their faithful
response (
⇒
 Psalm 33:12-22).

 [6] All their host: the stars of
the sky are commonly viewed as a vast army, e.g., 
⇒
 Nehemiah
9:6; 
⇒
 Isaiah 40:26;
⇒
 45:12; 
⇒
 Jeremiah
33:22.

 [7] The waters . . . as in a bowl:
ancients sometimes attributed the power keeping the seas from overwhelming land
to a primordial victory of the storm-god over personified Sea. God confines the
seas as easily as one puts water in a bowl.
