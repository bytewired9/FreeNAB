[1]
 A prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord, you
have been our refuge through all generations. 
2
Before the mountains were born, the earth and
the world brought forth, from eternity to eternity you are God. 
4
[2]
 A thousand years in your eyes are merely a
yesterday, 
3
[3]
 But humans you return to dust, saying,
"Return, you mortals!" 
4c
Before a watch passes in the night, 
5
[4]
 you have brought them to their end; They
disappear like sleep at dawn; they are like grass that dies. 
6
[5]
 It sprouts green in the morning; by evening it
is dry and withered. 
7
Truly we are consumed by your anger, filled
with terror by your wrath. 
8
You have kept our faults before you, our hidden
sins exposed to your sight. 
9
Our life ebbs away under your wrath; our years
end like a sigh. 
10
Seventy is the sum of our years, or eighty, if
we are strong; Most of them are sorrow and toil; they pass quickly, we are all
but gone. 
11
Who comprehends your terrible anger? Your wrath
matches the fear it inspires. 
12
Teach us to count our days aright, that we may
gain wisdom of heart. 
13
Relent, O LORD! How long? Have pity on your servants! 
14
Fill us at daybreak with your love, that all
our days we may sing for joy. 
15
Make us glad as many days as you humbled us,
for as many years as we have seen trouble. 
16
Show your deeds to your servants, your glory to
their children. 
17
May the favor of the Lord our God be ours.
Prosper the work of our hands! Prosper the work of our hands!

 [Psalm 90] A communal lament that
describes only in general terms the cause of the community's distress. After
confidently invoking God (
⇒
 Psalm 90:1), the psalm
turns to a complaint contrasting God's eternity with the brevity of human life
(
⇒
 Psalm 90:2-6) and sees in human suffering the
punishment for sin (
⇒
 Psalm 90:7-12). The psalm
concludes with a plea for God's intervention (
⇒
 Psalm
90:13-17). 
2
 [4] The translation reverses the
order of the difficult Hebrew verses 
⇒
 Psalm 90:3
and 4 to get the probable original order. A watch in the night: the night was
divided into three sentry periods or watches. Cf 
⇒
 Judges
7:19.
3
 [3] Return: one word of God is
enough to return mortals to the dust from which they were created. Humans were
created from earth in 
⇒
 Genesis 2:7;
⇒
 3:19.
4
 [5] You have brought them to their
end: an interpretation of the unclear Hebrew.
5
 [6] It is dry and withered: the
transitory nature of the grass under the scorching sun was proverbial. Cf
⇒
 Psalm 129:6; 
⇒
 Isaiah
40:6-8.
