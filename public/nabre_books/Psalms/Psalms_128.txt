 A song of ascents. 
[2]
 Happy
are all who fear the LORD, who walk in the ways of God.

What your hands provide you will enjoy; you
will be happy and prosper: 
3
Like a fruitful vine your wife within your
home, Like olive plants your children around your table. 
4
Just so will they be blessed who fear the LORD.
5
May the LORD bless you from Zion, all the days
of your life That you may share Jerusalem's joy

and live to see your children's children. Peace
upon Israel!

 Psalm
128:1). God's blessing is concrete: satisfaction and prosperity, a

 Psalm
128:2-4). The perspective is that of the adult male, ordinarily the
ruler and representative of the household to the community. The last verses

 Psalm 128:5-6).
