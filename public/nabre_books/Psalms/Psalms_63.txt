[1]
 A psalm of David, when he was in the
wilderness of Judah. 
2
O God, you are my God -  for you I long! For you my body yearns; for
you my soul thirsts, Like a land parched, lifeless, and without water. 
3
So I look to you in the sanctuary to see your
power and glory. 
4
[2]
 For your love is better than life; my lips
offer you worship! 
5
I will bless you as long as I live; I will lift
up my hands, calling on your name. 
6
My soul shall savor the rich banquet of praise,
with joyous lips my mouth shall honor you! 
7
When I think of you upon my bed, through the
night watches I will recall 
8
That you indeed are my help, and in the shadow
of your wings I shout for joy. 
9
My soul clings fast to you; your right hand
upholds me. 
10
But those who seek my life will come to ruin;
they shall go down to the depths of the earth! 
11
They shall be handed over to the sword and
become the prey of jackals! 
12
[3]
 But the king shall rejoice in God; all who
swear by the Lord shall exult, for the mouths of liars will be shut!

 [Psalm 63] A psalm expressing the
intimate relationship between God and the worshiper. Separated from God
(
⇒
 Psalm 63:2), the psalmist longs for the divine
life given in the temple (
⇒
 Psalm 63:3-6), which is
based on a close relationship with God (
⇒
 Psalm
63:7-9). May all my enemies be destroyed and God's true worshipers
continue in giving praise (
⇒
 Psalm 63:10-11)! 
2
 [4] For your love is better than
life: only here in the Old Testament is anything prized above life - in this
case God's love.
3
 [12] All who swear by the Lord: to
swear by a particular god meant that one was a worshiper of that god
(
⇒
 Isaiah 45:23; 
⇒
 48:1;
⇒
 Zephaniah 1:5).
