[1]
 For the leader. A psalm of David. 
2
Deliver me, LORD, from the wicked; preserve me
from the violent, 
3
From those who plan evil in their hearts, who
stir up conflicts every day, 
4
[2]
 Who sharpen their tongues like serpents, venom
of asps upon their lips. Selah 
5
Keep me, LORD, from the clutches of the wicked;
preserve me from the violent, who plot to trip me up. 
6
[3]
 The arrogant have set a trap for me; villains
have spread a net, laid snares for me by the wayside. Selah 
7
I say to the LORD: You are my God; listen,
LORD, to the words of my prayer. 
8
My revered LORD, my strong helper, my helmet on
the day of battle. 
9
LORD, do not grant the desires of the wicked;
do not let their plots succeed. Selah 
10
Around me they raise their proud heads; may the
mischief they threaten overwhelm them. 
11
May God rain burning coals upon them, cast them
into the grave never more to rise. 
12
Slanderers will not survive on earth; evil will
quickly entrap the violent. 
13
For I know the LORD will secure justice for the
needy, their rights for the poor. 
14
Then the just will give thanks to your name;
the upright will dwell in your presence.

 [Psalm 140] A lament seeking rescue
from violent and treacherous foes (
⇒
 Psalm
140:2-6). The psalmist remains trusting (
⇒
 Psalm
140:7-8), vigorously praying that the plans of the wicked recoil upon
themselves (
⇒
 Psalm 140:9-12). A serene statement
of praise ends the psalm (
⇒
 Psalm 140:13). The
psalmist is content to be known as one of "the needy," "the
poor," "the just," "the upright"
(
⇒
 Psalm 140:13), a class of people expecting
divine protection.
