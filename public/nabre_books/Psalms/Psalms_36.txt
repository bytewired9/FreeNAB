[1]
 For the leader. Of David, the servant of the
LORD. 
2
Sin directs the heart of the wicked; their eyes
are closed to the fear of God. 
3
[2]
 For they live with the delusion: their guilt
will not be known and hated. 
4
Empty and false are the words of their mouth; they
have ceased to be wise and do good. 
5
In their beds they hatch plots; they set out on
a wicked way; they do not reject evil. 
6
[3]
 LORD, your love reaches to heaven; your
fidelity, to the clouds. 
7
Your justice is like the highest mountains;
your judgments, like the mighty deep; all living creatures you sustain, LORD. 
8
[4]
 How precious is your love, O God! We take
refuge in the shadow of your wings. 
9
We feast on the rich food of your house; from
your delightful stream you give us drink. 
10
For with you is the fountain of life, and in
your light we see light. 
11
Continue your kindness toward your friends,
your just defense of the honest heart. 
12
Do not let the foot of the proud overtake me,
nor the hand of the wicked disturb me. 
13
There make the evildoers fall; thrust them
down, never to rise.

 [Psalm 36] A psalm with elements of
wisdom (
⇒
 Psalm 36:2-5), the hymn (
⇒
 Psalm
36:6-10), and the lament (
⇒
 Psalm
36:11-13). The rule of sin over the wicked (
⇒
 Psalm
36:2-5) is contrasted with the rule of divine love and mercy over
God's friends (
⇒
 Psalm 36:6-10). The psalm ends with
a prayer that God's guidance never cease (
⇒
 Psalm
36:11-12).

 [3] Hated: punished by God.
3
 [6-7] Love . . . judgments: God
actively controls the entire world.

 [8] The shadow of your wings:
metaphor for divine protection. It probably refers to the winged cherubim in
the holy of holies in the temple. Cf
