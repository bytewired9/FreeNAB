[1]
 For the leader. Of David. In the LORD I take
refuge; how can you say to me, "Flee like a bird to the mountains! 
2
See how the wicked string their bows, fit their
arrows to the string to shoot from the shadows at the upright. 
3
[2]
 When foundations are being destroyed, what can
the upright do?" 
4
The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD'S
throne is in heaven. God's eyes keep careful watch; they test all peoples. 
5
The LORD tests the good and the bad, hates
those who love violence, 
6
[3]
 And rains upon the wicked fiery coals and
brimstone, a scorching wind their allotted cup. 
7
The LORD is just and loves just deeds; the
upright shall see his face.
