[1]
 A song of ascents. Of David. I Had not the
LORD been with us, let Israel say, 
2
Had not the LORD been with us, when people rose
against us, 
3
They would have swallowed us alive, for their
fury blazed against us. 
4
The waters would have engulfed us, the torrent
overwhelmed us; 
5
seething waters would have drowned us. 
6
Blessed be the LORD, who did not leave us to be
torn by their fangs. 
7
We escaped with our lives like a bird from the
fowler's snare; the snare was broken and we escaped.

[2]
 Our help is the name of the LORD, the maker of
heaven and earth.

 [Psalm 124] A thanksgiving which
teaches that Israel's very existence is owed to God who rescues them. In the
first part Israel's enemies are compared to the mythic sea dragon
(

 Psalm 124:2b-3a; cf 
⇒
 Jeremiah
51:34) and Flood (
⇒
 Psalm 124:3b-5; cf
⇒
 Isaiah 51:9-10). The psalm heightens the malice of
human enemies by linking them to the primordial enemies of God's creation.
Israel is a bird freed from the trapper's snare (
⇒
 Psalm
124:6-8) - freed originally from Pharaoh and now from the current danger.
