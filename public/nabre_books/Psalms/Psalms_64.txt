[1]
 For the leader. A psalm of David. 
2
O God, hear my anguished voice; from the foes I
dread protect my life. 
3
Hide me from the malicious crowd, the mob of
evildoers. 
4
They sharpen their tongues like swords, ready
their bows for arrows of poison words. 
5
[2]
 They shoot at the innocent from ambush, shoot
without risk, catch them unawares. 
6
They resolve on their wicked plan; they conspire
to set snares; they say: "Who will see us?" 
7
They devise wicked schemes, conceal the schemes
they devise; the designs of their hearts are hidden. 
8
But God will shoot arrows at them and strike
them unawares. 
9
They will be brought down by their own tongues;
all who see them will shake their heads. 
10
Then all will fear and proclaim God's deed,
pondering what has been done. 
11
The just will rejoice and take refuge in the
LORD; all the upright will glory in their God.

 [Psalm 64] A lament of a person
overwhelmed by the malice of the wicked who are depicted in the psalms as the
enemies of the righteous (
⇒
 Psalm 64:2-7). When
people see God bringing upon the wicked the evil they intended against others,
they will know who is the true ruler of the world (
⇒
 Psalm
64:8-10) The final verse is a vow of praise
(
⇒
 Psalm 64:10 [11]).
