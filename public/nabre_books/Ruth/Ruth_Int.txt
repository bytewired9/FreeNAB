Introduction
Introduction 
The Book of Ruth
is named after the Moabite woman who was joined to the Israelite people by her
marriage with the influential Boaz of Bethlehem.
The book contains a
beautiful example of filial piety, pleasing to the Hebrews especially because
of its connection with King David, and useful both to Hebrews and to Gentiles.
Its aim is to demonstrate the divine reward for such piety even when practiced
by a stranger. Ruth's piety (
⇒
 Ruth 2:11), her
spirit of self-sacrifice, and her moral integrity were favored by God with the
gift of faith and an illustrious marriage whereby she became the ancestress of
David and of Christ. In this, the universality of the messianic salvation is
foreshadowed.
In the Greek and Latin
canons the Book of Ruth is placed just after Judges, to which it is closely
related because of the time of its action, and just before Samuel, for which it
is an excellent introduction, since it traces the ancestry of the Davidic
dynasty. One might characterize the literary form of this book as dramatic,
since about two-thirds of it is in dialogue. Yet there is every indication
that, as tradition has always held, it contains true history.
There is no certainty about
the author of the book. It was written long after the events had passed
(
⇒
 Ruth 4:7), which took place "in the time of
the judges" (
⇒
 Ruth 1:1).
