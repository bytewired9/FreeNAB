This letter is by
its address attributed to "Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ and brother of
James" (
⇒
 Jude 1:1). Since he is not identified
as an apostle, this designation can hardly be meant to refer to the Jude or
Judas who is listed as one of the Twelve (
⇒
 Luke
6:16; 
⇒
 Acts 1:13; cf
⇒
 John 14:22). The person intended is almost
certainly the other Jude, named in the gospels among the relatives of Jesus
(
⇒
 Matthew 13:55; 
⇒
 Mark
6:3), and the James who is listed there as his brother is the one to
whom the Letter of James is attributed (see the Introduction to James). Nothing
else is known of this Jude, and the apparent need to identify him by reference
to his better-known brother indicates that he was a rather obscure personage in
the early church.
The letter is addressed in
the most general terms to "those who are called, beloved in God the Father
and kept safe for Jesus Christ" (
⇒
 Jude 1:1),
hence apparently to all Christians. But since its purpose is to warn the
addressees against false teachers, the author must have had in mind one or more
specific Christian communities located in the unidentified region where the
errors in question constituted a danger. While the letter contains some Semitic
features, there is nothing to identify the addressees specifically as Jewish
Christians; indeed, the errors envisaged seem to reflect an early form of
gnosticism, opposed to law, that points rather to the cultural context of the Gentile
world. Like James and 2 Peter, the Letter of Jude manifests none of the typical
features of the letter form except the address.
There is so much similarity
between Jude and 2 Peter, especially 
⇒
 Jude 1:4-16
and 
⇒
 2 Peter 2:1-18, that there must be a literary
relationship between them. Since there is no evidence for the view that both
authors borrowed from the same source, it is usually supposed that one of them
borrowed from the other. Most scholars believe that Jude is the earlier of the
two, principally because he quotes two apocryphal Jewish works, the Assumption
of Moses (
⇒
 Jude 1:9) and the Book of Enoch
(
⇒
 Jude 1:14-15) as part of his structured
argument, whereas 2 Peter omits both references. Since there was controversy in
the early church about the propriety of citing noncanonical literature that
included legendary material, it is more probable that a later writer would omit
such references than that he would add them.
Many interpreters today
consider Jude a pseudonymous work dating from the end of the first century or
even later. In support of this view they adduce the following arguments: (a)
the apostles are referred to as belonging to an age that has receded into the
past (
⇒
 Jude 1:17-18); (b) faith is understood as a
body of doctrine handed down by a process of tradition (
⇒
1:3); (c) the author's competent Greek style shows that he must have
had a Hellenistic cultural formation; (d) the gnostic character of the errors
envisaged fits better into the early second century than into a period several
decades earlier. While impressive, these arguments are not entirely compelling and
do not completely rule out the possibility of composition around the year A.D.
80, when the historical Jude may still have been alive.
This little
letter is an urgent note by an author who intended to write more fully about
salvation to an unknown group of readers, but who was forced by dangers from
false teachers worming their way into the community (
⇒
1:3-4) to dash off a warning against them (
⇒
1:5-16) and to deliver some pressing Christian admonitions
(
⇒
 Jude 1:17-23). The letter is justly famous for
its majestic closing doxology (
⇒
1:24-25).
1
[1]
 Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ and brother of
James, 
[2]
 to those who are called, beloved in God the Father
and kept safe for Jesus Christ: 
2
may mercy, peace, and love be yours in
abundance. 
3
Beloved, although I was making every effort to
write to you about our common salvation, 
[3]
 I now feel a need
to write to encourage you to contend for the faith that was once for all handed
down to the holy ones. 
4
For there have been some intruders, who long
ago were designated for this condemnation, godless persons, who pervert the
grace of our God into licentiousness and who deny our only Master and Lord,
Jesus Christ. 
5
I wish to remind you, although you know all
things, that (the) Lord who once saved a people from the land of Egypt later
destroyed those who did not believe. 
[4]
6
The angels too, who did not keep to their own
domain but deserted their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains, in
gloom, for the judgment of the great day. 
[5]
7
Likewise, Sodom, Gomorrah, and the surrounding
towns, which, in the same manner as they, indulged in sexual promiscuity and
practiced unnatural vice, 
[6]
 serve as an example by
undergoing a punishment of eternal fire. 
8
Similarly, these dreamers 
[7]
nevertheless also defile the flesh, scorn lordship, and revile glorious beings.
9
Yet the archangel Michael, when he argued with
the devil in a dispute over the body of Moses, did not venture to pronounce a
reviling judgment 
[8]
 upon him but said, "May the Lord
rebuke you!" 
10
But these people revile what they do not
understand and are destroyed by what they know by nature like irrational
animals. 
11
Woe to them! They followed the way of Cain,
abandoned themselves to Balaam's error for the sake of gain, and perished in
the rebellion of Korah. 
[9]
12
These are blemishes on your love feasts, 
[10]
as they carouse fearlessly and look after themselves. They are waterless clouds
blown about by winds, fruitless trees in late autumn, twice dead and uprooted. 
13
They are like wild waves of the sea, foaming up
their shameless deeds, wandering stars for whom the gloom of darkness has been
reserved forever. 
14
[11]
 Enoch, of the seventh generation from Adam,
prophesied also about them when he said, "Behold, the Lord has come with
his countless holy ones 
15
to execute judgment on all and to convict
everyone for all the godless deeds that they committed and for all the harsh
words godless sinners have uttered against him." 
16
These people are complainers, disgruntled ones
who live by their desires; their mouths utter bombast as they fawn over people
to gain advantage. 
17
But you, beloved, remember the words spoken
beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
18
for they told you, "In (the) last time
there will be scoffers who will live according to their own godless
desires." 
[12]
19
These are the ones who cause divisions; they
live on the natural plane, devoid of the Spirit. 
20
But you, beloved, build yourselves up in your
most holy faith; pray in the holy Spirit. 
21
Keep yourselves in the love of God and wait for
the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life. 
22
On those who waver, have mercy; 
[13]
23
save others by snatching them out of the fire;
on others have mercy with fear, 
[14]
 abhorring even the outer
garment stained by the flesh. 
24
[15]
 To the one who is able to keep you from
stumbling and to present you unblemished and exultant, in the presence of his
glory, 
25
to the only God, our savior, through Jesus
Christ our Lord be glory, majesty, power, and authority from ages past, now,
and for ages to come. Amen. 
1
 [1] Jude . . . brother of James:
for the identity of the author of this letter, see Introduction.
2
 [1] To those who are called: the
vocation to the Christian faith is God's free gift to those whom he loves and
whom he safely protects in Christ until the Lord's second coming. 
3
 [3-4] Our common salvation: the
teachings of the Christian faith derived from the apostolic preaching and to be
kept by the Christian community.
4
 [5] For this first example of
divine punishment on those who had been saved but did not then keep faith, see
⇒
 Numbers 14:28-29 and the note there. Some manuscripts
have the word "once" (hapax as at 
⇒
1:3) after "you know"; some commentators have suggested
that it means "knowing one thing" or "you know all things once
for all." Instead of "[the] Lord" manuscripts vary, having
"Jesus," "God," or no subject stated.
5
 [6] This second example draws on
⇒
 Genesis 6:1-4 as elaborated in the apocryphal Book
of Enoch (cf 
⇒
 Jude 1:14): heavenly beings came to
earth and had sexual intercourse with women. God punished them by casting them
out of heaven into darkness and bondage.
6
 [7] Practiced unnatural vice:
literally, "went after alien flesh." This example derives from
⇒
 Genesis 19:1-25, especially
⇒
 Jude 1:4-11, when the townsmen of Sodom violated
both hospitality and morality by demanding that Lot's two visitors (really
messengers of Yahweh) be handed over to them so that they could abuse them
sexually. Unnatural vice: this refers to the desire for intimacies by human
beings with angels (the reverse of the example in 
⇒
1:6). Sodom (whence "sodomy") and Gomorrah became
proverbial as object lessons for God's punishment on sin (
⇒
 Isaiah
1:9; 
⇒
 Jeremiah 50:40;
⇒
 Amos 4:11; 
⇒
 Matthew
10:15; 
⇒
 2 Peter 2:6).
7
 [8] Dreamers: the writer returns to
the false teachers of 
⇒
 Jude 1:4, applying charges
from the three examples in 
⇒
 Jude 1:5,
6, 7. This may apply
to claims they make for revelations they have received by night (to the author,
hallucinations). Defile the flesh: this may mean bodily pollutions from the
erotic dreams of sexual license (
⇒
 Jude 1:7).
Lordship . . . glorious beings: these may reflect the Lord (
⇒
1:5; Jesus, 
⇒
 Jude 1:4) whom they spurn
and the angels (
⇒
 Jude 1:6; cf the note on
⇒
 2 Peter 2:10, here, as there, literally,
"glories").
8
 [9] The archangel Michael . . .
judgment: a reference to an incident in the apocryphal Assumption of Moses.
⇒
 Deut 34:6 had said of Moses, literally in Greek,
"they buried him" or "he (God?) buried him" (taken to mean
"he was buried"). The later account tells how Michael, who was sent
to bury him, was challenged by the devil's interest in the body. Our author
draws out the point that if an archangel refrained from reviling even the
devil, how wrong it is for mere human beings to revile glorious beings
(angels).
9
 [11] Cain . . . Balaam . . . Korah: examples of rebellious men
and of the punishment their conduct incurred; cf 
⇒
 Genesis
4:8-16; 
⇒
 Numbers 16:1-35; 
⇒
 31:16.
See the note on 
⇒
 2 Peter 2:15.
10
 [12] Blemishes on your love feasts:
or "hidden rocks" or "submerged reefs" (cf
⇒
 Jude 1:13). The opponents engaged in scandalous
conduct in connection with community gatherings called love feasts (agape
meals), which were associated with eucharistic celebrations at certain stages
of early Christian practice; cf 
⇒
 1 Cor 11:18-34
and the note on 
⇒
 2 Peter 2:13.
11
 [14-15] Cited from the apocryphal
Book of Enoch 1:9.
12
 [18] This is the substance of much
early Christian preaching rather than a direct quotation of any of the various
New Testament passages on this theme (see 
⇒
 Mark
13:22; 
⇒
 Acts 20:30; 
⇒
 1
Tim 4:1-3; 
⇒
 2 Peter 3:3).
13
 [22] Have mercy: some manuscripts
read "convince," "confute," or "reprove." Others
have "even though you waver" or "doubt" instead of who
waver.
14
 [23] With fear: some manuscripts
connect the phrase "with fear" with the imperative "save"
or with the participle "snatching." Other manuscripts omit the phrase
"on others have mercy," so that only two groups are envisioned.
Rescue of those led astray and caution in the endeavor are both enjoined. Outer
garment stained by the flesh: the imagery may come from
⇒
 Zechariah 3:3-5, just as that of snatching . . .
out of the fire comes from 
⇒
 Zechariah 3:2; the very
garments of the godless are to be abhorred because of their contagion.
15
 [24-25] With this liturgical
statement about the power of God to keep the faithful from stumbling, and
praise to him through Jesus Christ, the letter reaches its conclusion by
returning to the themes with which it began (
⇒
1:1-2).
