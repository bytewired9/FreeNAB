Introduction
The fifth and last book of the Pentateuch is
called Deuteronomy, meaning "second law." In reality, what it
contains is not a new law but a partial repetition, completion and explanation
of the law proclaimed on Mount Sinai. The historical portions of the book are
also a resume of what is related elsewhere in the Pentateuch. The chief
characteristic of this book is its vigorous oratorical style. In a series of
eloquent discourses Moses presents the theme of covenant renewal in a vital
liturgical framework. He exhorts, corrects and threatens his people, appealing
to their past glory, their historic mission, and the promise of future triumph.
His aim is to enforce among the Israelites the Lord's claim to their obedience,
loyalty and love. The events contained in the Book of Deuteronomy took place in
the plains of Moab (
⇒
 Deut 1:5) between the end of
the wanderings in the desert (
⇒
 Deut 1:3) and the
crossing of the Jordan River (
⇒
 Joshua 4:19), a
period of no more than forty days. The Book of Deuteronomy, written after the
Israelites had for centuries been resident in the Land of Promise, takes the
form of a testament of Moses, the great leader and legislator, to his people on
the eve of his death. At the time of our Lord's coming, it shared with the
Psalms a preeminent religious influence among the Old Testament books. The
Savior quoted passages of Deuteronomy in overcoming the threefold temptation of
Satan in the desert (Mat 4; 
⇒
 Deut 6:13,
⇒
 16; 
⇒
 8:3;
⇒
 10:20), and in explaining to the lawyer the first
and greatest commandment (
⇒
 Matthew 22:35-39;
⇒
 Deut 6:4).
