While Ezra prayed and acknowledged their guilt,
weeping and prostrate before the house of God, a very large assembly of
Israelites gathered about him, men, women, and children; and the people wept
profusely. 
2
Then Shecaniah, the son of Jehiel, one of the
sons of Elam, made this appeal to Ezra: "We have indeed betrayed our God
by taking as wives foreign women of the peoples of the land. Yet even now there
remains a hope for Israel. 
3
Let us therefore enter into a covenant before
our God to dismiss all our foreign wives and the children born of them, in
keeping with what you, my lord, advise, and those who fear the commandments of
our God. Let the law be observed! 
4
Rise, then, for this is your duty! We will
stand by you, so have courage and take action!" 
5
Ezra rose to his feet and demanded an oath from
the chiefs of the priests, from the Levites and from all Israel that they would
do as had been proposed; and they swore it. 
6
[1]
 Then Ezra retired from his place before the
house of God and entered the chamber of Johanan, son of Eliashib, where he
spent the night neither eating food nor drinking water, for he was in mourning
over the betrayal by the exiles. 
7
A proclamation was made throughout Judah and
Jerusalem that all the exiles should gather together in Jerusalem, 
8
and that whoever failed to appear within three
days would, according to the judgment of the leaders and elders, suffer the
confiscation of all his possessions, and himself be excluded from the assembly
of the exiles. 
9
[2]
 All the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered
together in Jerusalem within the three-day period: it was in the ninth month,
on the twentieth day of the month. All the people, standing in the open place
before the house of God, were trembling both over the matter at hand and
because it was raining. 
10
Then Ezra, the priest, stood up and said to
them: "Your unfaithfulness in taking foreign women as wives has added to
Israel's guilt. 
11
But now, give praise to the LORD, the God of
your fathers, and do his will: separate yourselves from the peoples of the land
and from these foreign women." 
12
In answer, the whole assembly cried out with a
loud voice: "Yes, it is our duty to do as you say! 
13
But the people are numerous and it is the rainy
season, so that we cannot remain out-of-doors; besides, this is not a task that
can be performed in a single day or even two, for those of us who have sinned
in this regard are many. 
14
Let our leaders represent the whole assembly;
then let all those in our cities who have taken foreign women for wives appear
at appointed times, accompanied by the elders and magistrates of each city in
question, till we have turned away from us our God's burning anger over this
affair." 
15
Only Jonathan, son of Asahel, and Jahzeiah, son
of Tikvah, were against this proposal, with Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite
supporting them. 
16
[3]
 The exiles did as agreed. Ezra appointed as
his assistants men who were family heads, one for each family, all of them
designated by name. They held sessions to examine the matter, beginning with
the first day of the tenth month. 
17
By the first day of the first month they had
passed judgment on all the men who had taken foreign women for wives. 
18
Among the priests, the following were found to
have taken foreign women for wives: Of the sons of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and
his brethren: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah. 
19
They pledged themselves to dismiss their wives,
and as a guilt-offering for their guilt they gave a ram from the flock. 
20

21
of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah,

31

32
Benjamin, Malluch, Shemariah; 
33
of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah,
Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, Shimei; 
34
of the sons of Begui: Maadai, Amram, Uel, 
35
Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi, 
36
Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, 
37

38

39
Shelemiah, Nathan, and Adaiah; 
40
of the sons of Zachai: Shashai, Sharai, 
41
Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah, 
42
Shallum, Amariah, Joseph; 
43
of the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad,
Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, Benaiah. 
44
[4]
 All these had taken foreign wives; but they
sent them away, both the women and their children.

 [6] Johanan, son of Eliashib:
actually, the grandson of Eliashib; the father of Johanan was Eliashib's son
Joiada (
⇒
 Nehemiah 12:10-11,
⇒
 22). Since Eliashib was high priest at the time
of Nehemiah (
⇒
 Nehemiah 3:1,
⇒
 20-21; 
⇒
 13:4,
7) and Johanan, if not yet high priest, was at
least old enough to have his own separate quarters (chamber) in the temple at
the time of Ezra, it is practically certain that Nehemiah's activity in
Jerusalem must have preceded that of Ezra. 
2
 [9] Ninth month: Chislev
(November-December), during the "early rains" in Palestine. Since the
assembly took place in the open . . . all the people . . . were trembling . . .
because it was raining.
3
 [16-17] The work of the committee
lasted three months, from the first day of the tenth month, Tebet
(December-January), to the first day of the first month, Nisan (March-April),
of the following Jewish year.

 [44] The account of the problem of
mixed marriages at the time of Ezra is continued in 
⇒
 Nehemiah
9:1-5; this may be read immediately after 
⇒
10:44 though the date given in 
⇒
 Nehemiah
9:1 fits more precisely after 
⇒
10:15; cf 
⇒
 Haggai 2:10-14.
