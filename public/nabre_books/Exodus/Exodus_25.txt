This is what the LORD then said to Moses: 
2
"Tell the Israelites to take up a
collection for me. From every man you shall accept the contribution that his heart
prompts him to give me. 
3
These are the contributions you shall accept
from them: gold, silver and bronze; 
4
violet, purple and scarlet yarn; fine linen and
goat hair; 
5
[1]
 rams' skins dyed red, and tahash skins; acacia
wood; 
6
oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil
and for the fragrant incense; 
7
onyx stones and other gems for mounting on the
ephod and the breastpiece. 
8
"They shall make a sanctuary for me, that
I may dwell in their midst. 
9
This Dwelling and all its furnishings you shall
make exactly according to the pattern that I will now show you. 
10
"You shall make an ark of acacia wood, two
and a half cubits long, one and a half cubits wide, and one and a half cubits
high. 
11
Plate it inside and outside with pure gold, and
put a molding of gold around the top of it. 
12
Cast four gold rings and fasten them on the
four supports of the ark, two rings on one side and two on the opposite side. 
13
Then make poles of acacia wood and plate them
with gold. 
14
These poles you are to put through the rings on
the sides of the ark, for carrying it; 
15
they must remain in the rings of the ark and
never be withdrawn. 
16
In the ark you are to put the commandments
which I will give you. 
17
[2]
 "You shall then make a propitiatory of
pure gold, two cubits and a half long, and one and a half cubits wide. 
18
[3]
 Make two cherubim of beaten gold for the two
ends of the propitiatory, 
19
fastening them so that one cherub springs
direct from each end. 
20
The cherubim shall have their wings spread out
above, covering the propitiatory with them; they shall be turned toward each
other, but with their faces looking toward the propitiatory. 
21
This propitiatory you shall then place on top
of the ark. In the ark itself you are to put the commandments which I will give
you. 
22
There I will meet you and there, from above the
propitiatory, between the two cherubim on the ark of the commandments, I will
tell you all the commands that I wish you to give the Israelites. 
23
"You shall also make a table of acacia
wood, two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high. 
24
Plate it with pure gold and make a molding of
gold around it. 
25
[4]
 Surround it with a frame, a handbreadth high,
with a molding of gold around the frame. 
26
You shall also make four rings of gold for it
and fasten them at the four corners, one at each leg, 
27
on two opposite sides of the frame as holders
for the poles to carry the table. 
28
These poles for carrying the table you shall
make of acacia wood and plate with gold. 
29
[5]
 Of pure gold you shall make its plates and
cups, as well as its pitchers and bowls for pouring libations. 
30
On the table you shall always keep showbread
set before me. 
31
"You shall make a lampstand of pure beaten
gold - its shaft and branches - with its cups and knobs and petals springing
directly from it. 
32
Six branches are to extend from the sides of
the lampstand, three branches on one side, and three on the other. 
33
[6]
 On one branch there are to be three cups,
shaped like almond blossoms, each with its knob and petals; on the opposite
branch there are to be three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, each with its
knob and petals; and so for the six branches that extend from the lampstand. 
34
[7]
 On the shaft there are to be four cups, shaped
like almond blossoms, with their knobs and petals, 
35
including a knob below each of the three pairs
of branches that extend from the lampstand. 
36
Their knobs and branches shall so spring from
it that the whole will form but a single piece of pure beaten gold. 
37
[8]
 You shall then make seven lamps for it and so
set up the lamps that they shed their light on the space in front of the
lampstand. 
38
[9]
 These, as well as the trimming shears and
trays, must be of pure gold. 
39
Use a talent of pure gold for the lampstand and
all its appurtenances. 
40
See that you make them according to the pattern
shown you on the mountain. 
1
 [5] Tahash: perhaps the name of a
marine animal, such as the dugong or the porpoise. The Greek and Latin versions
took it for the color hyacinth.
2
 [17] Propitiatory: this traditional
rendering of the Hebrew term, which may mean merely "cover," is
derived from its connection with the ceremony of the Day of Atonement whereby
God was rendered "propitious." Cf 
⇒
 Lev 16:14,
⇒
 16.
3
 [18-20] Cherubim: probably in the
form of human-headed winged lions. The cherubim over the ark formed the throne
for the invisible Lord. Cf 
⇒
 Psalm 80:2. For a more
detailed description of the somewhat different cherubim in the temple of
Solomon, see 
⇒
 1 Kings 6:23-28;
⇒
 2 Chron 3:10-13.
4
 [25] A frame: probably placed near
the bottom of the legs to keep them steady. The golden table of Herod's temple
is pictured thus on the Arch of Titus.
5
 [29-30] The plates held the
showbread, that is, the holy bread which was placed upon the table every
sabbath as an offering to God, and was later eaten by the priests. The cups held
the incense which was strewn upon the bread. Cf 
⇒
 Lev
24:5-9. The libation wine was poured from the pitchers into the
bowls. All these vessels were kept on the golden table.
6
 [33] In keeping with the
arrangement of the ornaments on the shaft, the three sets of ornaments on each
branch were probably so placed that one was at the top and the other two
equally spaced along the length of the branch. Knob: the cup-shaped seed
capsule at the base of a flower.
7
 [34-35] Of the four ornaments on
the shaft, one was at the top and one was below each of the three sets of side
branches.
8
 [37] The lamps were probably shaped
like small boats, with the wick at one end; the end with the wick was turned
toward the front of the lampstand.
9
 [38] Trays: small receptacles for
the burnt-out wicks.
