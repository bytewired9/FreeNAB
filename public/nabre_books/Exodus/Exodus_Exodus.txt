Introduction
The
second book of the Pentateuch is called Exodus from the Greek word for
"departure," because the central event narrated in it is the
departure of the Israelites from Egypt. It continues the history of the chosen
people from the point where the Book of Genesis leaves off. It recounts the
oppression by the Egyptians of the ever-increasing descendants of Jacob and
their miraculous deliverance by God through Moses, who led them across the Red
Sea to Mount Sinai where they entered into a special covenant with the Lord.
These events were of prime importance to the chosen people, for they became
thereby an independent nation and enjoyed a unique relationship with God.
Through Moses God gave to the Israelites at Mount Sinai the "law":
the moral, civil and ritual legislation by which they were to become a holy
people, in whom the promise of a Savior for all mankind would be fulfilled.
