 Meanwhile Moses was tending the flock of his father-in-law
Jethro, the priest of Midian. Leading the flock across the desert, he came to
Horeb, the mountain of God. 
2
[2]
 There an angel of the LORD appeared to him in
fire flaming out of a bush. As he looked on, he was surprised to see that the
bush, though on fire, was not consumed. 
3
So Moses decided, "I must go over to look
at this remarkable sight, and see why the bush is not burned." 
4
When the LORD saw him coming over to look at it
more closely, God called out to him from the bush, "Moses! Moses!" He
answered, "Here I am." 
5
God said, "Come no nearer! Remove the
sandals from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground. 
6
[3]
 I am the God of your father," he
continued, "the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob."
Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God. 
7
But the LORD said, "I have witnessed the
affliction of my people in Egypt and have heard their cry of complaint against
their slave drivers, so I know well what they are suffering. 
8
[4]
 Therefore I have come down to rescue them from
the hands of the Egyptians and lead them out of that land into a good and
spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey, the country of the
Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. 
9
So indeed the cry of the Israelites has reached
me, and I have truly noted that the Egyptians are oppressing them. 
10
Come, now! I will send you to Pharaoh to lead
my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt." 
11
[5]
 But Moses said to God, "Who am I that I
should go to Pharaoh and lead the Israelites out of Egypt?" 
12
He answered, "I will be with you; and this
shall be your proof that it is I who have sent you: when you bring my people
out of Egypt, you will worship God on this very mountain." 
13
"But," said Moses to God, "when
I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to
you,' if they ask me, 'What is his name?' what am I to tell them?" 
14
[6]
 God replied, "I am who am." Then he
added, "This is what you shall tell the Israelites: I AM sent me to
you." 
15
God spoke further to Moses, "Thus shall
you say to the Israelites: The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. "This is
my name forever; this is my title for all generations. 
16
[7]
 "Go and assemble the elders of the
Israelites, and tell them: The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has appeared to me and said: I am concerned about you
and about the way you are being treated in Egypt; 
17
so I have decided to lead you up out of the
misery of Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites,
Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
18
"Thus they will heed your message. Then
you and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him: The
LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent us word. Permit us, then, to go a three
days' journey in the desert, that we may offer sacrifice to the LORD, our God. 
19
"Yet I know that the king of Egypt will
not allow you to go unless he is forced. 
20
I will stretch out my hand, therefore, and
smite Egypt by doing all kinds of wondrous deeds there. After that he will send
you away. 
21
I will even make the Egyptians so well-disposed
toward this people that, when you leave, you will not go empty-handed. 
22
[8]
 Every woman shall ask her neighbor and her
house guest for silver and gold articles and for clothing to put on your sons
and daughters. Thus you will despoil the Egyptians." 
1
 [1] The mountain of God: probably
given this designation because of the divine apparitions which took place
there, such as on this occasion and when the Israelites were there after the
departure from Egypt.
2
 [2] An angel of the LORD: the
visual form under which God appeared and spoke to men is referred to indifferently
in some Old Testament texts either as God's angel or as God himself. Cf
⇒
 Genesis 16:7, 
⇒
 13;
⇒
 Exodus 14:19, 
⇒
 24,
⇒
 25; 
⇒
 Numbers
22:22-35; Jdgs 6,11-18.
3
 [6] The appearance of God caused
fear of death, since it was believed that no one could see God and live; cf
⇒
 Genesis 32:30. The God of Abraham . . . Jacob:
cited by Christ in proof of the resurrection since the patriarchs, long dead,
live on in God who is the God of the living. Cf 
⇒
 Matthew
22:32; 
⇒
 Mark 12:26;
⇒
 Luke 20:37.
4
 [8] I have come down: a figure of
speech signifying an extraordinary divine intervention in human affairs. Cf 
⇒
 Genesis
11:5, 7. Flowing with milk and honey: an expression
denoting agricultural prosperity, which seems to have been proverbial in its
application to Palestine. Cf 13:5; 
⇒
 Numbers 13:27;

 Joshua 5:6;

 Jeremiah
11:5;

 [11] Who am I: besides naturally
shrinking from such a tremendous undertaking, Moses realized that, as a
fugitive from Pharaoh, he could hardly hope to carry out a mission to him.
Perhaps he also recalled that on one occasion even his own kinsmen questioned
his authority. Cf
⇒
 Exodus 2:14.
6
 [14] I am who am: apparently this
utterance is the source of the word Yahweh, the proper personal name of the God
of Israel. It is commonly explained in reference to God as the absolute and
necessary Being. It may be understood of God as the Source of all created
beings. Out of reverence for this name, the term Adonai, "my Lord,"
was later used as a substitute. The word LORD in the present version represents
this traditional usage. The word "Jehovah" arose from a false reading
of this name as it is written in the current Hebrew text.
7
 [16] Elders: the Israelite leaders,
who were usually older men. They were representatives of the people.
8
 [22] Articles: probably jewelry.
Despoil: this was permissible, that the Israelites might compensate themselves
for their many years of servitude; besides, the Egyptians would give these
things willingly. Cf

 Exodus 12:33-36.
