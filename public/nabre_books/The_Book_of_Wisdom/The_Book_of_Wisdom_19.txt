 But the wicked, merciless wrath assailed until
the end. For he knew beforehand what they were yet to do: 
2
[2]
 That though they themselves had agreed to the departure
and had anxiously sent them on their way, they would regret it and pursue them.
3
[3]
 For while they were still engaged in funeral
rites and were mourning at the burials of the dead, They adopted another
senseless plan; and those whom they had sent away with entreaty, they pursued
as fugitives. 
4
For a compulsion suited to this ending drew
them on, and made them forgetful of what had befallen them, That they might
fill out the torments of their punishment, 
5
[4]
 and your people might experience a glorious
journey while those others met an extraordinary death. 
6
For all creation, in its several kinds, was
being made over anew, serving its natural laws, that your children might be
preserved unharmed. 
7
The cloud overshadowed their camp; and out of
what had before been water, dry land was seen emerging: Out of the Red Sea an
unimpeded road, and a grassy plain out of the mighty flood. 
8
Over this crossed the whole nation sheltered by
your hand, after they beheld stupendous wonders. 
9
For they ranged about like horses, and bounded
about like lambs, praising you, O LORD! their deliverer. 
10
For they were still mindful of what had
happened in their sojourn: how instead of the young of animals the land brought
forth gnats, and instead of fishes the river swarmed with countless frogs. 
11
And later they saw also a new kind of bird
when, prompted by desire, they asked for pleasant foods; 
12
For to appease them quail came to them from the
sea. 
13
[5]
 And the punishments came upon the sinners only
after forewarnings from the violence of the thunderbolts. For they justly
suffered for their own misdeeds, since indeed they treated their guests with
the more grievous hatred. 
14
For those others did not receive unfamiliar
visitors, but these were enslaving beneficent guests. 
15
[6]
 And not that only; but what punishment was to
be theirs since they received strangers unwillingly! 
16
Yet these, after welcoming them with
festivities, oppressed with awful toils those who now shared with them the same
rights. 
17
And they were struck with blindness, as those
others had been at the portals of the just - When, surrounded by yawning
darkness, each sought the entrance of his own gate. 
18
For the elements, in variable harmony among
themselves, like strings of the harp, produce new melody, while the flow of
music steadily persists. And this can be perceived exactly from a review of
what took place. 
19
For land creatures were changed into water
creatures, and those that swam went over on to the land. 
20
Fire in water maintained its own strength, and
water forgot its quenching nature; 
21
Flames, by contrast, neither consumed the flesh
of the perishable animals that went about in them, nor melted the icelike,
quick-melting kind of ambrosial food. 
22
For every way, O LORD! you magnified and
glorified your people; unfailing, you stood by them in every time and
circumstance.
