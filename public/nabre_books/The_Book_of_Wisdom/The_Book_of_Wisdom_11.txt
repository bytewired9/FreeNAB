She made their affairs prosper through the holy
prophet. 
2
[1]
 They journeyed through the uninhabited desert,
and in solitudes they pitched their tents; 
3
they withstood enemies and took vengeance on
their foes. 
4
When they thirsted, they called upon you, and
water was given them from the sheer rock, assuagement for their thirst from the
hard stone. 
5
For by the things through which their foes were
punished they in their need were benefited. 
6
[2]
 Instead of a spring, when the perennial river
was troubled with impure blood 
7
as a rebuke to the decree for the slaying of
infants, You gave them abundant water in an unhoped-for way, 
8
once you had shown by the thirst they then had how
you punished their adversaries. 
9
For when they had been tried, though only
mildly chastised, they recognized how the wicked, condemned in anger, were
being tormented. 
11
Both those afar off and those close by were afflicted:
10
the latter you tested, admonishing them as a
father; the former as a stern king you probed and condemned. 
12
For a twofold grief took hold of them and a
groaning at the remembrance of the ones who had departed. 
13
For when they heard that the cause of their own
torments was a benefit to these others, they recognized the Lord. 
14
Him who of old had been cast out in exposure
they indeed mockingly rejected; but in the end of events, they marveled at him,
since their thirst proved unlike that of the just. 
15
[3]
 And in return for their senseless, wicked
thoughts, which misled them into worshiping dumb serpents and worthless
insects, You sent upon them swarms of dumb creatures for vengeance; 
16
that they might recognize that a man is
punished by the very things through which he sins. 
17
For not without means was your almighty hand,
that had fashioned the universe from formless matter, to send upon them a drove
of bears or fierce lions, 
18
Or new-created, wrathful, unknown beasts to
breathe forth fiery breath, Or pour out roaring smoke, or flash terrible sparks
from their eyes. 
19
Not only could these attack and completely
destroy them; even their frightful appearance itself could slay. 
20
Even without these, they could have been killed
at a single blast, pursued by retribution and winnowed out by your mighty spirit;
But you have disposed all things by measure and number and weight. 
21
For with you great strength abides always; who
can resist the might of your arm? 
22
[4]
 Indeed, before you the whole universe is as a grain
from a balance, or a drop of morning dew come down upon the earth. 
23
But you have mercy on all, because you can do
all things; and you overlook the sins of men that they may repent. 
24
For you love all things that are and loathe
nothing that you have made; for what you hated, you would not have fashioned. 
25
And how could a thing remain, unless you willed
it; or be preserved, had it not been called forth by you? 
26
But you spare all things, because they are
yours, O LORD and lover of souls,

 [2-4] Few verses in these later
chapters can be fully understood without consulting the passages in the Mosaic
books which are indicated in the cross references. The theme of this part of
the book is expressed in 
⇒
 Wisdom 11:5 and is
illustrated in the following chapters by five examples drawn from Exodus
events.

 [6-8] The perennial river: the
Nile; the contrast is between the first plague of Egypt
(

 Exodus 7:17-24) and the water drawn from the rock
in Horeb (
⇒
 Exodus 17:5-7;
⇒
 Numbers 20:8-11).
