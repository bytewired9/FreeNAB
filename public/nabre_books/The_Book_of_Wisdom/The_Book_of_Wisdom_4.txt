[1]
 Better is childlessness with virtue; for
immortal is its memory: because both by God is it acknowledged, and by men. 
2
When it is present men imitate it, and they
long for it when it is gone; And forever it marches crowned in triumph,
victorious in unsullied deeds of valor. 
3
But the numerous progeny of the wicked shall be
of no avail; their spurious offshoots shall not strike deep root nor take firm
hold. 
4
For even though their branches flourish for a
time, they are unsteady and shall be rocked by the wind and, by the violence of
the winds, uprooted; 
5
Their twigs shall be broken off untimely, and
their fruit be useless, unripe for eating, and fit for nothing. 
6
For children born of lawless unions give
evidence of the wickedness of their parents, when they are examined. 
7
But the just man, though he die early, shall be
at rest. 
8
For the age that is honorable comes not with
the passing of time, nor can it be measured in terms of years. 
9
Rather, understanding is the hoary crown for
men, and an unsullied life, the attainment of old age.

[2]
 He who pleased God was loved; he who lived
among sinners was transported -  
11
Snatched away, lest wickedness pervert his mind
or deceit beguile his soul; 
12
For the witchery of paltry things obscures what
is right and the whirl of desire transforms the innocent mind. 
13
Having become perfect in a short while, he
reached the fullness of a long career; 
14
for his soul was pleasing to the LORD,
therefore he sped him out of the midst of wickedness. But the people saw and
did not understand, nor did they take this into account. 
15
[3]
16
Yes, the just man dead condemns the sinful who
live, and youth swiftly completed condemns the many years of the wicked man
grown old. 
17
For they see the death of the wise man and do
not understand what the LORD intended for him, or why he made him secure. 
18
They see, and hold him in contempt; but the
LORD laughs them to scorn. 
19
And they shall afterward become dishonored
corpses and an unceasing mockery among the dead. For he shall strike them down
speechless and prostrate and rock them to their foundations; They shall be
utterly laid waste and shall be in grief and their memory shall perish. 
20
[4]
 Fearful shall they come, at the counting up of
their sins, and their lawless deeds shall convict them to their face.

adaptation which is applied in the liturgy to the splendor of virginity.
