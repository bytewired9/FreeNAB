[1]
 Therefore they were fittingly punished by
similar creatures, and were tormented by a swarm of insects. 
2
Instead of this punishment, you benefited your people
with a novel dish, the delight they craved, by providing quail for their food; 
3
That those others, when they desired food,
since the creatures sent to plague them were so loathsome, should be turned
from even the craving of necessities, While these, after a brief period of
privation, partook of a novel dish. 
4
For upon those oppressors, inexorable want had
to come; but these needed only be shown how their enemies were being tormented.
5
For when the dire venom of beasts came upon
them and they were dying from the bite of crooked serpents, your anger endured
not to the end. 
6
[2]
 But as a warning, for a short time they were
terrorized, though they had a sign of salvation, to remind them of the precept
of your law. 
7
For he who turned toward it was saved, not by
what he saw, but by you, the savior of all. 
8
And by this also you convinced our foes that
you are he who delivers from all evil. 
9
For the bites of locusts and of flies slew
them, and no remedy was found to save their lives because they deserved to be
punished by such means; 
10
But not even the fangs of poisonous reptiles
overcame your sons, for your mercy brought the antidote to heal them. 
11
For as a reminder of your injunctions, they
were stung, and swiftly they were saved, Lest they should fall into deep
forgetfulness and become unresponsive to your beneficence. 
12
For indeed, neither herb nor application cured
them, but your all-healing word, O LORD! 
13
For you have dominion over life and death; you
lead down to the gates of the nether world, and lead back. 
14
[3]
 Man, however, slays in his malice, but when
the spirit has come away, it does not return, nor can he bring back the soul
once it is confined. 
15
But your hand none can escape. 
16
For the wicked who refused to know you were
punished by the might of your arm, Pursued by unwonted rains and hailstorms and
unremitting downpours, and consumed by fire. 
17
For against all expectation, in water which
quenches anything, the fire grew more active; For the universe fights on behalf
of the just. 
18
For now the flame was tempered so that the
beasts might not be burnt up that were sent upon the wicked, but that these
might see and know they were struck by the judgment of God; 
19
And again, even in the water, fire blazed
beyond its strength so as to consume the produce of the wicked land. 
20
Instead of this, you nourished your people with
food of angels and furnished them bread from heaven, ready to hand,
untoiled-for, endowed with all delights and conforming to every taste. 
21
For this substance of yours revealed your
sweetness toward your children, and serving the desire of him who received it,
was blended to whatever flavor each one wished. 
22
[4]
 Yet snow and ice withstood fire and were not
melted, that they might know that their enemies' fruits Were consumed by a fire
that blazed in the hail and flashed lightning in the rain. 
23
But this fire, again, that the just might be
nourished, forgot even its proper strength; 
24
For your creation, serving you, its maker,
grows tense for punishment against the wicked, but is relaxed in benefit for
those who trust in you. 
25
Therefore at that very time, transformed in all
sorts of ways, it was serving your all-nourishing bounty according to what they
needed and desired; 
26
That your sons whom you loved might learn, O LORD,
that it is not the various kinds of fruits that nourish man, but it is your
word that preserves those who believe you! 
27
For what was not destroyed by fire, when merely
warmed by a momentary sunbeam, melted; 
28
So that men might know that one must give you
thanks before the sunrise, and turn to you at daybreak. 
29
For the hope of the ingrate melts like a wintry
frost and runs off like useless water.
