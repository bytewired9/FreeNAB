 For all men were by nature foolish who were in
ignorance of God, and who from the good things seen did not succeed in knowing
him who is, and from studying the works did not discern the artisan; 
2
[2]
 But either fire, or wind, or the swift air, or
the circuit of the stars, or the mighty water, or the luminaries of heaven, the
governors of the world, they considered gods. 
3
Now if out of joy in their beauty they thought
them gods, let them know how far more excellent is the Lord than these; for the
original source of beauty fashioned them. 
4
Or if they were struck by their might and
energy, let them from these things realize how much more powerful is he who
made them. 
5
For from the greatness and the beauty of
created things their original author, by analogy, is seen. 
6
[3]
 But yet, for these the blame is less; For they
indeed have gone astray perhaps, though they seek God and wish to find him. 
7
For they search busily among his works, but are
distracted by what they see, because the things seen are fair. 
8
But again, not even these are pardonable. 
9
For if they so far succeeded in knowledge that
they could speculate about the world, how did they not more quickly find its
LORD? 
10
But doomed are they, and in dead things are
their hopes, who termed gods things made by human hands: Gold and silver, the
product of art, and likenesses of beasts, or useless stone, the work of an
ancient hand. 
11
A carpenter may saw out a suitable tree and
skillfully scrape off all its bark, And deftly plying his art, produce
something fit for daily use, 
12
and use up the refuse from his handiwork in
preparing his food, and have his fill; 
13
Then the good-for-nothing refuse from these
remnants, crooked wood grown full of knots, he takes and carves to occupy his
spare time. This wood he models with listless skill, and patterns it on the
image of a man 
14
or makes it resemble some worthless beast. When
he has daubed it with red and crimsoned its surface with red stain, and daubed
over every blemish in it, 
15
He makes a fitting shrine for it and puts it on
the wall, fastening it with a nail. 
16
Thus lest it fall down he provides for it,
knowing that it cannot help itself; for, truly, it is an image and needs help. 
17
But when he prays about his goods or marriage
or children, he is not ashamed to address the thing without a soul. And for
vigor he invokes the powerless; 
18
and for life he entreats the dead; And for aid
he beseeches the wholly incompetent, and about travel, something that cannot
even walk. 
19
And for profit in business and success with his
hands he asks facility of a thing with hands completely inert.
