they who said among themselves, thinking not
aright: "Brief and troublous is our lifetime; neither is there any remedy
for man's dying, nor is anyone known to have come back from the nether world. 
2
For haphazard were we born, and hereafter we
shall be as though we had not been; Because the breath in our nostrils is a
smoke and reason is a spark at the beating of our hearts, 
3
And when this is quenched, our body will be
ashes and our spirit will be poured abroad like unresisting air. 
4
Even our name will be forgotten in time, and no
one will recall our deeds. So our life will pass away like the traces of a
cloud, and will be dispersed like a mist pursued by the sun's rays and
overpowered by its heat. 
5
For our lifetime is the passing of a shadow;
and our dying cannot be deferred because it is fixed with a seal; and no one
returns. 
6
Come, therefore, let us enjoy the good things
that are real, and use the freshness of creation avidly. 
7
Let us have our fill of costly wine and
perfumes, and let no springtime blossom pass us by; 
8
let us crown ourselves with rosebuds ere they
wither. 
9
[1]
 Let no meadow be free from our wantonness;
everywhere let us leave tokens of our rejoicing, for this our portion is, and
this our lot. 
10
Let us oppress the needy just man; let us
neither spare the widow nor revere the old man for his hair grown white with
time. 
11
But let our strength be our norm of justice;
for weakness proves itself useless. 
12
[2]
[3]
 Let us beset the just
one, because he is obnoxious to us; he sets himself against our doings,
Reproaches us for transgressions of the law and charges us with violations of
our training. 
13
He professes to have knowledge of God and
styles himself a child of the LORD. 
14
To us he is the censure of our thoughts; merely
to see him is a hardship for us, 
15
Because his life is not like other men's, and
different are his ways. 
16
He judges us debased; he holds aloof from our
paths as from things impure. He calls blest the destiny of the just and boasts
that God is his Father. 
17
Let us see whether his words be true; let us
find out what will happen to him. 
18
For if the just one be the son of God, he will
defend him and deliver him from the hand of his foes. 
19
With revilement and torture let us put him to
the test that we may have proof of his gentleness and try his patience. 
20
Let us condemn him to a shameful death; for
according to his own words, God will take care of him." 
21
These were their thoughts, but they erred; for
their wickedness blinded them, 
22
And they knew not the hidden counsels of God;
neither did they count on a recompense of holiness nor discern the innocent
souls' reward. 
23
For God formed man to be imperishable; the
image of his own nature he made him. 
24
But by the envy of the devil, death entered the
world, and they who are in his possession experience it.

the extant Greek Mss have "Let none of us be without part in our wanton
doings." Most Latin Mss have both forms of this line.

Passion of our Lord; many have understood these verses as a direct prophecy. Cf
