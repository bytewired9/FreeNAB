[1]
 But the souls of the just are in the hand of
God, and no torment shall touch them. 
2
They seemed, in the view of the foolish, to be
dead; and their passing away was thought an affliction 
3
and their going forth from us, utter
destruction. But they are in peace. 
4
For if before men, indeed, they be punished,
yet is their hope full of immortality; 
5
Chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed,
because God tried them and found them worthy of himself. 
6
[2]
 As gold in the furnace, he proved them, and as
sacrificial offerings he took them to himself. 
7
[3]
 In the time of their visitation they shall
shine, and shall dart about as sparks through stubble; 
8
They shall judge nations and rule over peoples,
and the LORD shall be their King forever. 
9
Those who trust in him shall understand truth,
and the faithful shall abide with him in love: Because grace and mercy are with
his holy ones, and his care is with the elect. 
10
[4]
 But the wicked shall receive a punishment to
match their thoughts, since they neglected justice and forsook the LORD. 
11
For he who despises wisdom and instruction is
doomed. Vain is their hope, fruitless are their labors, and worthless are their
works. 
12
Their wives are foolish and their children
wicked; accursed is their brood. 
13
[5]
 Yes, blessed is she who, childless and
undefiled, knew not transgression of the marriage bed; she shall bear fruit at
the visitation of souls. 
14
[6]
 So also the eunuch whose hand wrought no
misdeed, who held no wicked thoughts against the LORD - For he shall be given
fidelity's choice reward and a more gratifying heritage in the LORD'S temple. 
15
For the fruit of noble struggles is a glorious
one; and unfailing is the root of understanding. 
16
But the children of adulterers will remain
without issue, and the progeny of an unlawful bed will disappear. 
17
For should they attain long life, they will be
held in no esteem, and dishonored will their old age be at last; 
18
While should they die abruptly, they have no
hope nor comfort in the day of scrutiny; 
19
for dire is the end of the wicked generation.
