Introduction
The Book of
Wisdom was written about a hundred years before the coming of Christ. Its
author, whose name is not known to us, was a member of the Jewish community at Alexandria,
in Egypt. He wrote in Greek, in a style patterned on that of Hebrew verse. At
times he speaks in the person of Solomon, placing his teachings on the lips of
the wise king of Hebrew tradition in order to emphasize their value. His
profound knowledge of the earlier Old Testament writings is reflected in almost
every line of the book, and marks him, like Ben Sira, as an outstanding
representative of religious devotion and learning among the sages of postexilic
Judaism.
The primary purpose of the
sacred author was the edification of his co-religionists in a time when they
had experienced suffering and oppression, in part at least at the hands of
apostate fellow Jews. To convey his message he made use of the most popular
religious themes of his time, namely the splendor and worth of divine wisdom
(

 Wisdom 6:22-
⇒
 11:1),
the glorious events of the Exodus (
⇒
 Wisdom
11:2-16; 
⇒
 12:23-27; 
⇒
 15:18
⇒
 19:22), God's mercy (
⇒
 Wisdom
11:17-
⇒
 12:22), the folly of idolatry
(
⇒
 Wisdom 13:1-
⇒
 15:17),
and the manner in which God's justice is vindicated in rewarding or punishing
the individual soul (
⇒
 Wisdom
1:1-
⇒
 6:21). The first ten chapters
especially form a preparation for the fuller teachings of Christ and his
Church. Many passages from this section of the book, notably
⇒
 Wisdom 3:1-8, are used by the Church in her
liturgy.
