[1]
 Indeed, she reaches from end to end mightily
and governs all things well. 
2
Her I loved and sought after from my youth; I
sought to take her for my bride and was enamored of her beauty. 
3
She adds to nobility the splendor of
companionship with God; even the LORD of all loved her. 
4
For she is instructress in the understanding of
God, the selector of his works. 
5
And if riches be a desirable possession in
life, what is more rich than Wisdom, who produces all things? 
6
And if prudence renders service, who in the
world is a better craftsman than she? 
7
[2]
 Or if one loves justice, the fruits of her
works are virtues; For she teaches moderation and prudence, justice and
fortitude, and nothing in life is more useful for men than these. 
8
Or again, if one yearns for copious learning,
she knows the things of old, and infers those yet to come. She understands the
turns of phrases and the solutions of riddles; signs and wonders she knows in
advance and the outcome of times and ages. 
9
So I determined to take her to live with me,
knowing that she would be my counselor while all was well, and my comfort in
care and grief. 
10
For her sake I should have glory among the
masses, and esteem from the elders, though I be but a youth. 
11
I should become keen in judgment, and should be
a marvel before rulers. 
12
[3]
 They would abide my silence and attend my
utterance; and as I spoke on further, they would place their hands upon their
mouths. 
13
For her sake I should have immortality and
leave to those after me an everlasting memory. 
14
I should govern peoples, and nations would be
my subjects- 
15
terrible princes, hearing of me, would be
afraid; in the assembly I should appear noble, and in war courageous. 
16
Within my dwelling, I should take my repose
beside her; For association with her involves no bitterness and living with her
no grief, but rather joy and gladness. 
17
Thinking thus within myself, and reflecting in
my heart That there is immortality in kinship with Wisdom, 
18
and good pleasure in her friendship, and unfailing
riches in the works of her hands, And that in frequenting her society there is
prudence, and fair renown in sharing her discourses, I went about seeking to
take her for my own. 
19
[4]
 Now, I was a well-favored child, and I came by
a noble nature; 
20
or rather, being noble, I attained an unsullied
body. 
21
[5]
 And knowing that I could not otherwise possess
her except God gave it -  and this, too,
was prudence, to know whose is the gift - 
I went to the LORD and besought him, and said with all my heart: 
1
 [1] End to end: from one end of the
heavens to the other. 
2
 [7] Moderation . . . fortitude:
what are now known as the cardinal virtues.
3
 [12] Hands upon their mouths: an
oft-mentioned sign of respect among the ancients for unanswerable wisdom; cf
⇒
 Job 40:4.
4
 [19-20] Here the sacred writer
mentions first bodily, then spiritual, excellence. To make it plain that the
latter is the governing factor in the harmonious development of the human
person, he then reverses the order.
5
 [21] Possess her: in the Latin,
"be continent." Though this verse has often been cited in connection
with the virtue of chastity, the original must certainly mean "be
possessed of Wisdom."
