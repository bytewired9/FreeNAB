Kings
Introduction
The two Books of
Kings were originally, like 1 Sam; 2 Sam - a single historical work. In
conjunction with the Books of Samuel, they extend the consecutive history of
Israel from the birth of Samuel to the destruction of Jerusalem in 587 B.C.
This combined work is designed as a religious history; hence in Kings the
temple, which is the chosen site for the worship of Yahweh, occupies the center
of attention.
The Books of Kings show
clearly the theological bent of a Deuteronomic editor. In them, as already in
Judges, material from various sources, such as the "book of the acts of
Solomon" (
⇒
 1 Kings 11:41) and the "book
of the chronicles of the kings of Israel" (
⇒
14:19), is forged into structural unity by an editor whose principal
interest is in the fidelity to Yahweh of rulers and people. The reigns of
individual kings are adapted to an editorial framework consisting of a
presentation and an obituary notice for each, in stereotyped formulas. In
between, the achievements of the king are reported-above all, his fidelity or
lack of fidelity to Yahweh. The faithful prosper; the unfaithful pay for their
defections. Since this is basically a narrative of sin and retribution, it
would not be inappropriate to entitle the Books of Kings "The Rise and
Fall of the Israelite Monarchy."
Without minimizing the
complexity of the process by which this material was transmitted for many
centuries, one may speak of two editions of the Books: the first at some time
between 621 B.C. and 597 B.C., and the second, final edition during the Exile;
probably shortly after Jehoiachin was released from his Babylonian prison (561
B.C.).
1 Kings carries the history
of Israel from the last days and death of David to the accession in Samaria of
Ahaziah, son of Ahab, near the end of the reign of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.
Judgment is passed on Ahaziah's reign but the details are given only later, in
2 Kings. We should note the two large cycles of traditions which grew up around
the great prophetic figures of Elijah and Elisha, the former in 1 Kings and the
latter chiefly in 2 Kings. These cycles, which interrupt the sequence of regnal
chronicles, were very probably preserved and transmitted by the prophetic
communities to which there are references in the same traditions. The Elijah
cycle is the more important since it dramatically underscores Israel's critical
struggle with the religion of Canaan.

the Books of Kings are:
